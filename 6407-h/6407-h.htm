    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION&mdash;(1831.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      From what is said in the Introduction to the Monastery, it must
      necessarily be inferred, that the Author considered that romance as
      something very like a failure. It is true, the booksellers did not
      complain of the sale, because, unless on very felicitous occasions, or on
      those which are equally the reverse, literary popularity is not gained or
      lost by a single publication. Leisure must be allowed for the tide both to
      flow and ebb. But I was conscious that, in my situation, not to advance
      was in some Degree to recede, and being naturally unwilling to think that
      the principle of decay lay in myself, I was at least desirous to know of a
      certainty, whether the degree of discountenance which I had incurred, was
      now owing to an ill-managed story, or an ill-chosen subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was never, I confess, one of those who are willing to suppose the brains
      of an author to be a kind of milk, which will not stand above a single
      creaming, and who are eternally harping to young authors to husband their
      efforts, and to be chary of their reputation, lest it grow hackneyed in
      the eyes of men. Perhaps I was, and have always been, the more indifferent
      to the degree of estimation in which I might be held as an author, because
      I did not put so high a value as many others upon what is termed literary
      reputation in the abstract, or at least upon the species of popularity
      which had fallen to my share; for though it were worse than affectation to
      deny that my vanity was satisfied at my success in the department in which
      chance had in some measure enlisted me, I was, nevertheless, far from
      thinking that the novelist or romance-writer stands high in the ranks of
      literature. But I spare the reader farther egotism on this subject, as I
      have expressed my opinion very fully in the Introductory Epistle to the
      Fortunes of Nigel, first edition; and, although it be composed in an
      imaginary character, it is as sincere and candid as if it had been written
      &ldquo;without my gown and band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, when I considered myself as having been unsuccessful in the
      Monastery, I was tempted to try whether I could not restore, even at the
      risk of totally losing, my so-called reputation, by a new hazard&mdash;I
      looked round my library, and could not but observe, that, from the time of
      Chaucer to that of Byron, the most popular authors had been the most
      prolific. Even the aristarch Johnson allowed that the quality of readiness
      and profusion had a merit in itself, independent of the intrinsic value of
      the composition. Talking of Churchill, I believe, who had little merit in
      his prejudiced eyes, he allowed him that of fertility, with some such
      qualification as this, &ldquo;A Crab-apple can bear but crabs after all; but
      there is a great difference in favour of that which bears a large quantity
      of fruit, however indifferent, and that which produces only a few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking more attentively at the patriarchs of literature, whose earner was
      as long as it was brilliant, I thought I perceived that in the busy and
      prolonged course of exertion, there were no doubt occasional failures, but
      that still those who were favourites of their age triumphed over these
      miscarriages. By the new efforts which they made, their errors were
      obliterated, they became identified with the literature of their country,
      and after having long received law from the critics, came in some degree
      to impose it. And when such a writer was at length called from the scene,
      his death first made the public sensible what a large share he had
      occupied in their attention. I recollected a passage in Grimm's
      Correspondence, that while the unexhausted Voltaire sent forth tract after
      tract to the very close of a long life, the first impression made by each
      as it appeared, was, that it was inferior to its predecessors; an opinion
      adopted from the general idea that the Patriarch of Ferney must at last
      find the point from which he was to decline. But the opinion of the public
      finally ranked in succession the last of Voltaire's Essays on the same
      footing with those which had formerly charmed the French nation. The
      inference from this and similar facts seemed to me to be, that new works
      were often judged of by the public, not so much from their own intrinsic
      merit, as from extrinsic ideas which readers had previously formed with
      regard to them, and over which a writer might hope to triumph by patience
      and by exertion. There is risk in the attempt;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this is a chance incident to every literary attempt, and by which men
      of a sanguine temper are little moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may illustrate what I mean, by the feelings of most men in travelling.
      If we have found any stage particularly tedious, or in an especial degree
      interesting, particularly short, or much longer than we expected, our
      imaginations are so apt to exaggerate the original impression, that, on
      repeating the journey, we usually find that we have considerably
      over-rated the predominating quality, and the road appears to be duller or
      more pleasant, shorter or more tedious, than what we expected, and,
      consequently, than what is actually the case. It requires a third or
      fourth journey to enable us to form an accurate judgment of its beauty,
      its length, or its other attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same manner, the public, judging of a new work, which it receives
      perhaps with little expectation, if surprised into applause, becomes very
      often ecstatic, gives a great deal more approbation than is due, and
      elevates the child of its immediate favour to a rank which, as it affects
      the author, it is equally difficult to keep, and painful to lose. If, on
      this occasion, the author trembles at the height to which he is raised,
      and becomes afraid of the shadow of his own renown, he may indeed retire
      from the lottery with the prize which he has drawn, but, in future ages,
      his honour will be only in proportion to his labours. If, on the contrary,
      he rushes again into the lists, he is sure to be judged with severity
      proportioned to the former favour of the public. If he be daunted by a bad
      reception on this second occasion, he may again become a stranger to the
      arena. If, on the contrary, he can keep his ground, and stand the
      shuttlecock's fate, of being struck up and down, he will probably, at
      length, hold with some certainty the level in public opinion which he may
      be found to deserve; and he may perhaps boast of arresting the general
      attention, in the same manner as the Bachelor Samson Carrasco, of fixing
      the weathercock La Giralda of Seville for weeks, months, or years, that
      is, for as long as the wind shall uniformly blow from one quarter. To this
      degree of popularity the author had the hardihood to aspire, while, in
      order to attain it, he assumed the daring resolution to keep himself in
      the view of the public by frequent appearances before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be added, that the author's incognito gave him greater courage to
      renew his attempts to please the public, and an advantage similar to that
      which Jack the Giant-killer received from his coat of darkness. In sending
      the Abbot forth so soon after the Monastery, he had used the well-known
      practice recommended by Bassanio:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,
  I shot another of the self-same flight,
  The self-same way, with more advised watch,
  To find the other forth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And, to continue the simile, his shafts, like those of the lesser Ajax,
      were discharged more readily that the archer was as inaccessible to
      criticism, personally speaking, as the Grecian archer under his brother's
      sevenfold shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the reader desire to know upon what principles the Abbot was
      expected to amend the fortune of the Monastery, I have first to request
      his attention to the Introductory Epistle addressed to the imaginary
      Captain Clutterbuck; a mode by which, like his predecessors in this walk
      of fiction, the real author makes one of his <i>dramatis personae</i> the
      means of communicating his own sentiments to the public, somewhat more
      artificially than by a direct address to the readers. A pleasing French
      writer of fairy tales, Monsieur Pajon, author of the History of Prince
      Soly, has set a diverting example of the same machinery, where he
      introduces the presiding Genius of the land of Romance conversing with one
      of the personages of the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Introductory Epistle, the author communicates, in confidence, to
      Captain Clutterbuck, his sense that the White Lady had not met the taste
      of the times, and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene. The
      author did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting another
      alteration. The Monastery was designed, at first, to have contained some
      supernatural agency, arising out of the fact, that Melrose had been the
      place of deposit of the great Robert Bruce's heart. The writer shrunk,
      however, from filling up, in this particular, the sketch as it was
      originally traced; nor did he venture to resume, in continuation, the
      subject which he had left unattempted in the original work. Thus, the
      incident of the discovery of the heart, which occupies the greater part of
      the Introduction to the Monastery, is a mystery unnecessarily introduced,
      and which remains at last very imperfectly explained. In this particular,
      I was happy to shroud myself by the example of the author of &ldquo;Caleb
      Williams,&rdquo; who never condescends to inform us of the actual contents of
      that Iron Chest which makes such a figure in his interesting work, and
      gives the name to Mr. Colman's drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public had some claim to inquire into this matter, but it seemed
      indifferent policy in the author to give the explanation. For, whatever
      praise may be due to the ingenuity which brings to a general combination
      all the loose threads of a narrative, like the knitter at the finishing of
      her stocking, I am greatly deceived if in many cases a superior advantage
      is not attained, by the air of reality which the deficiency of explanation
      attaches to a work written on a different system. In life itself, many
      things befall every mortal, of which the individual never knows the real
      cause or origin; and were we to point out the most marked distinction
      between a real and a fictitious narrative, we would say, that the former
      in reference to the remote causes of the events it relates, is obscure,
      doubtful, and mysterious; whereas, in the latter case, it is a part of the
      author's duty to afford satisfactory details upon the causes of the
      separate events he has recorded, and, in a word, to account for every
      thing. The reader, like Mungo in the Padlock, will not be satisfied with
      hearing what he is not made fully to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I omitted, therefore, in the Introduction to the Abbot, any attempt to
      explain the previous story, or to apologize for unintelligibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither would it have been prudent to have endeavoured to proclaim, in the
      Introduction to the Abbot, the real spring, by which I hoped it might
      attract a greater degree of interest than its immediate predecessor. A
      taking title, or the announcement of a popular subject, is a recipe for
      success much in favour with booksellers, but which authors will not always
      find efficacious. The cause is worth a moment's examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      There occur in every country some peculiar historical characters, which
      are, like a spell or charm, sovereign to excite curiosity and attract
      attention, since every one in the slightest degree interested in the land
      which they belong to, has heard much of them, and longs to hear more. A
      tale turning on the fortunes of Alfred or Elizabeth in England, or of
      Wallace or Bruce in Scotland, is sure by the very announcement to excite
      public curiosity to a considerable degree, and ensure the publisher's
      being relieved of the greater part of an impression, even before the
      contents of the work are known. This is of the last importance to the
      bookseller, who is at once, to use a technical phrase, &ldquo;brought home,&rdquo; all
      his outlay being repaid. But it is a different case with the author, since
      it cannot be denied that we are apt to feel least satisfied with the works
      of which we have been induced, by titles and laudatory advertisements, to
      entertain exaggerated expectations. The intention of the work has been
      anticipated, and misconceived or misrepresented, and although the
      difficulty of executing the work again reminds us of Hotspur's task of
      &ldquo;o'er-walking a current roaring loud,&rdquo; yet the adventurer must look for
      more ridicule if he fails, than applause if he executes, his undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding a risk, which should make authors pause ere they adopt a
      theme which, exciting general interest and curiosity, is often the
      preparative for disappointment, yet it would be an injudicious regulation
      which should deter the poet or painter from attempting to introduce
      historical portraits, merely from the difficulty of executing the task in
      a satisfactory manner. Something must be trusted to the generous impulse,
      which often thrusts an artist upon feats of which he knows the difficulty,
      while he trusts courage and exertion may afford the means of surmounting
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is especially when he is sensible of losing ground with the public,
      that an author may be justified in using with address, such selection of
      subject or title as is most likely to procure a rehearing. It was with
      these feelings of hope and apprehension, that I venture to awaken, in a
      work of fiction, the memory of Queen Mary, so interesting by her wit, her
      beauty, her misfortunes, and the mystery which still does, and probably
      always will, overhang her history. In doing so, I was aware that failure
      would be a conclusive disaster, so that my task was something like that of
      an enchanter who raises a spirit over whom he is uncertain of possessing
      an effectual control; and I naturally paid attention to such principles of
      composition, as I conceived were best suited to the historical novel.

      Enough has been already said to explain the purpose of composing the
      Abbot. The historical references are, as usual, explained in the notes.
      That which relates to Queen Mary's escape from Lochleven Castle, is a more
      minute account of that romantic adventure, than is to be found in the
      histories of the period.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY EPISTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FROM THE AUTHOR OF &ldquo;WAVERLEY,&rdquo; TO CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK, LATE OF HIS
      MAJESTY'S &mdash;&mdash; REGIMENT OF INFANTRY.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR CAPTAIN:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry to observe, by your last favour, that you disapprove of the
      numerous retrenchments and alterations which I have been under the
      necessity of making on the Manuscript of your friend, the Benedictine, and
      I willingly make you the medium of apology to many, who have honoured me
      more than I deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that my retrenchments have been numerous, and leave gaps in the
      story, which, in your original manuscript, would have run well-nigh to a
      fourth volume, as my printer assures me. I am sensible, besides, that, in
      consequence of the liberty of curtailment you have allowed me, some parts
      of the story have been huddled up without the necessary details. But,
      after all, it is better that the travellers should have to step over a
      ditch, than to wade through a morass&mdash;that the reader should have to
      suppose what may easily be inferred, than be obliged to creep through
      pages of dull explanation. I have struck out, for example, the whole
      machinery of the White Lady, and the poetry by which it is so ably
      supported, in the original manuscript. But you must allow that the public
      taste gives little encouragement to those legendary superstitions, which
      formed alternately the delight and the terror of our predecessors. In like
      manner, much is omitted illustrative of the impulse of enthusiasm in
      favour of the ancient religion in Mother Magdalen and the Abbot. But we do
      not feel deep sympathy at this period with what was once the most powerful
      and animating principle in Europe, with the exception of that of the
      Reformation, by which it was successfully opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You rightly observe, that these retrenchments have rendered the title no
      longer applicable to the subject, and that some other would have been more
      suitable to the Work, in its present state, than that of THE ABBOT, who
      made so much greater figure in the original, and for whom your friend, the
      Benedictine, seems to have inspired you with a sympathetic respect. I must
      plead guilty to this accusation, observing, at the same time, in manner of
      extenuation, that though the objection might have been easily removed, by
      giving a new title to the Work, yet, in doing so, I should have destroyed
      the necessary cohesion between the present history, and its predecessor
      THE MONASTERY, which I was unwilling to do, as the period, and several of
      the personages, were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, my good friend, it is of little consequence what the work is
      called, or on what interest it turns, provided it catches the public
      attention; for the quality of the wine (could we but insure it) may,
      according to the old proverb, render the bush unnecessary, or of little
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I congratulate you upon your having found it consistent with prudence to
      establish your Tilbury, and approve of the colour, and of your boy's
      livery, (subdued green and pink.)&mdash;As you talk of completing your
      descriptive poem on the &ldquo;Ruins of Kennaquhair, with notes by an
      Antiquary,&rdquo; I hope you have procured a steady horse.&mdash;I remain, with
      compliments to all friends, dear Captain, very much
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.

</pre>
    <p>
      The time which passes over our heads so imperceptibly, makes the same
      gradual change in habits, manners, and character, as in personal
      appearance. At the revolution of every five years we find ourselves
      another, and yet the same&mdash;there is a change of views, and no less of
      the light in which we regard them; a change of motives as well as of
      actions. Nearly twice that space had glided away over the head of Halbert
      Glendinning and his lady, betwixt the period of our former narrative, in
      which they played a distinguished part, and the date at which our present
      tale commences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two circumstances only had imbittered their union, which was otherwise as
      happy as mutual affection could render it. The first of these was indeed
      the common calamity of Scotland, being the distracted state of that
      unhappy country, where every man's sword was directed against his
      neighbour's bosom. Glendinning had proved what Murray expected of him, a
      steady friend, strong in battle, and wise in counsel, adhering to him,
      from motives of gratitude, in situations where by his own unbiassed will
      he would either have stood neuter, or have joined the opposite party.
      Hence, when danger was near&mdash;and it was seldom far distant&mdash;Sir
      Halbert Glendinning, for he now bore the rank of knighthood, was
      perpetually summoned to attend his patron on distant expeditions, or on
      perilous enterprises, or to assist him with his counsel in the doubtful
      intrigues of a half-barbarous court. He was thus frequently, and for a
      long space, absent from his castle and from his lady; and to this ground
      of regret we must add, that their union had not been blessed with
      children, to occupy the attention of the Lady of Avenel, while she was
      thus deprived of her husband's domestic society.
    </p>
    <p>
      On such occasions she lived almost entirely secluded from the world,
      within the walls of her paternal mansion. Visiting amongst neighbors was a
      matter entirely out of the question, unless on occasions of solemn
      festival, and then it was chiefly confined to near kindred. Of these the
      Lady of Avenel had none who survived, and the dames of the neighbouring
      barons affected to regard her less as the heiress of the house of Avenel
      than as the wife of a peasant, the son of a church-vassal, raised up to
      mushroom eminence by the capricious favour of Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pride of ancestry, which rankled in the bosom of the ancient gentry,
      was more openly expressed by their ladies, and was, moreover, imbittered
      not a little by the political feuds of the time, for most of the Southern
      chiefs were friends to the authority of the Queen, and very jealous of the
      power of Murray. The Castle of Avenel was, therefore, on all these
      accounts, as melancholy and solitary a residence for its lady as could
      well be imagined. Still it had the essential recommendation of great
      security. The reader is already aware that the fortress was built upon an
      islet on a small lake, and was only accessible by a causeway, intersected
      by a double ditch, defended by two draw-bridges, so that without
      artillery, it might in those days be considered as impregnable. It was
      only necessary, therefore, to secure against surprise, and the service of
      six able men within the castle was sufficient for that purpose. If more
      serious danger threatened, an ample garrison was supplied by the male
      inhabitants of a little hamlet, which, under the auspices of Halbert
      Glendinning, had arisen on a small piece of level ground, betwixt the lake
      and the hill, nearly adjoining to the spot where the causeway joined the
      mainland. The Lord of Avenel had found it an easy matter to procure
      inhabitants, as he was not only a kind and beneficent overlord, but well
      qualified, both by his experience in arms, his high character for wisdom
      and integrity, and his favour with the powerful Earl of Murray, to protect
      and defend those who dwelt under his banner. In leaving his castle for any
      length of time, he had, therefore, the consolation to reflect, that this
      village afforded, on the slightest notice, a band of thirty stout men,
      which was more than sufficient for its defence; while the families of the
      villagers, as was usual on such occasions, fled to the recesses of the
      mountains, drove their cattle to the same places of shelter, and left the
      enemy to work their will on their miserable cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      One guest only resided generally, if not constantly, at the Castle of
      Avenel. This was Henry Warden, who now felt himself less able for the
      stormy task imposed on the reforming clergy; and having by his zeal given
      personal offence to many of the leading nobles and chiefs, did not
      consider himself as perfectly safe, unless when within the walls of the
      strong mansion of some assured friend. He ceased not, however, to serve
      his cause as eagerly with his pen, as he had formerly done with his
      tongue, and had engaged in a furious and acrimonious contest, concerning
      the sacrifice of the mass, as it was termed, with the Abbot Eustatius,
      formerly the Sub-Prior of Kennaquhair. Answers, replies, duplies,
      triplies, quadruplies, followed thick upon each other, and displayed, as
      is not unusual in controversy, fully as much zeal as Christian charity.
      The disputation very soon became as celebrated as that of John Knox and
      the Abbot of Crosraguel, raged nearly as fiercely, and, for aught I know,
      the publications to which it gave rise may be as precious in the eyes of
      bibliographers. [Footnote: The tracts which appeared in the Disputation
      between the Scottish Reformer and Quentin Kennedy, Abbot of Crosraguel,
      are among the scarcest in Scottish Bibliography. See M'Crie's <i>Life of
      Knox</i>, p. 258.] But the engrossing nature of his occupation rendered
      the theologian not the most interesting companion for a solitary female;
      and his grave, stern, and absorbed deportment, which seldom showed any
      interest, except in that which concerned his religious profession, made
      his presence rather add to than diminish the gloom which hung over the
      Castle of Avenel. To superintend the tasks of numerous female domestics,
      was the principal part of the Lady's daily employment; her spindle and
      distaff, her Bible, and a solitary walk upon the battlements of the
      castle, or upon the causeway, or occasionally, but more seldom, upon the
      banks of the little lake, consumed the rest of the day. But so great was
      the insecurity of the period, that when she ventured to extend her walk
      beyond the hamlet, the warder on the watch-tower was directed to keep a
      sharp look-out in every direction, and four or five men held themselves in
      readiness to mount and sally forth from the castle on the slightest
      appearance of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus stood affairs at the castle, when, after an absence of several weeks,
      the Knight of Avenel, which was now the title most frequently given to Sir
      Halbert Glendinning, was daily expected to return home. Day after day,
      however, passed away, and he returned not. Letters in those days were
      rarely written, and the Knight must have resorted to a secretary to
      express his intentions in that manner; besides, intercourse of all kinds
      was precarious and unsafe, and no man cared to give any public intimation
      of the time and direction of a journey, since, if his route were publicly
      known, it was always likely he might in that case meet with more enemies
      than friends upon the road. The precise day, therefore, of Sir Halbert's
      return, was not fixed, but that which his lady's fond expectation had
      calculated upon in her own mind had long since passed, and hope delayed
      began to make the heart sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the evening of a sultry summer's day, when the sun was
      half-sunk behind the distant western mountains of Liddesdale, that the
      Lady took her solitary walk on the battlements of a range of buildings,
      which formed the front of the castle, where a flat roof of flag-stones
      presented a broad and convenient promenade. The level surface of the lake,
      undisturbed except by the occasional dipping of a teal-duck, or coot, was
      gilded with the beams of the setting luminary, and reflected, as if in a
      golden mirror, the hills amongst which it lay embossed. The scene,
      otherwise so lonely, was occasionally enlivened by the voices of the
      children in the village, which, softened by distance, reached the ear of
      the Lady, in her solitary walk, or by the distant call of the herdsman, as
      he guided his cattle from the glen in which they had pastured all day, to
      place them in greater security for the night, in the immediate vicinity of
      the village. The deep lowing of the cows seemed to demand the attendance
      of the milk-maidens, who, singing shrilly and merrily, strolled forth,
      each with her pail on her head, to attend to the duty of the evening. The
      Lady of Avenel looked and listened; the sounds which she heard reminded
      her of former days, when her most important employment, as well as her
      greatest delight, was to assist Dame Glendinning and Tibb Tackett in
      milking the cows at Glendearg. The thought was fraught with melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was I not,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the peasant girl which in all men's eyes I
      seemed to be? Halbert and I had then spent our life peacefully in his
      native glen, undisturbed by the phantoms either of fear or of ambition.
      His greatest pride had then been to show the fairest herd in the Halidome;
      his greatest danger to repel some pilfering snatcher from the Border; and
      the utmost distance which would have divided us, would have been the chase
      of some outlying deer. But, alas! what avails the blood which Halbert has
      shed, and the dangers which he encounters, to support a name and rank,
      dear to him because he has it from me, but which we shall never transmit
      to our posterity! with me the name of Avenel must expire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed as the reflections arose, and, looking towards the shore of the
      lake, her eye was attracted by a group of children of various ages,
      assembled to see a little ship, constructed by some village artist,
      perform its first voyage on the water. It was launched amid the shouts of
      tiny voices and the clapping of little hands, and shot bravely forth on
      its voyage with a favouring wind, which promised to carry it to the other
      side of the lake. Some of the bigger boys ran round to receive and secure
      it on the farther shore, trying their speed against each other as they
      sprang like young fawns along the shingly verge of the lake. The rest, for
      whom such a journey seemed too arduous, remained watching the motions of
      the fairy vessel from the spot where it had been launched. The sight of
      their sports pressed on the mind of the childless Lady of Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are none of these prattlers mine?&rdquo; she continued, pursuing the tenor
      of her melancholy reflections. &ldquo;Their parents can scarce find them the
      coarsest food&mdash;and I, who could nurse them in plenty, I am doomed
      never to hear a child call me mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought sunk on her heart with a bitterness which resembled envy, so
      deeply is the desire of offspring implanted in the female breast. She
      pressed her hands together as if she were wringing them in the extremity
      of her desolate feeling, as one whom Heaven had written childless. A large
      stag-hound of the greyhound species approached at this moment, and
      attracted perhaps by the gesture, licked her hands and pressed his large
      head against them. He obtained the desired caresses in return, but still
      the sad impression remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wolf,&rdquo; she said, as if the animal could have understood her complaints,
      &ldquo;thou art a noble and beautiful animal; but, alas! the love and affection
      that I long to bestow, is of a quality higher than can fall to thy share,
      though I love thee much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as if she were apologizing to Wolf for withholding from him any part
      of her regard, she caressed his proud head and crest, while, looking in
      her eyes, he seemed to ask her what she wanted, or what he could do to
      show his attachment. At this moment a shriek of distress was heard on the
      shore, from the playful group which had been lately so jovial. The Lady
      looked, and saw the cause with great agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little ship, the object of the children's delighted attention, had
      stuck among some tufts of the plant which bears the water-lily, that
      marked a shoal in the lake about an arrow-flight from the shore. A hardy
      little boy, who had taken the lead in the race round the margin of the
      lake, did not hesitate a moment to strip off his <i>wylie-coat</i>, plunge
      into the water, and swim towards the object of their common solicitude.
      The first movement of the Lady was to call for help; but she observed that
      the boy swam strongly and fearlessly, and as she saw that one or two
      villagers, who were distant spectators of the incident, seemed to give
      themselves no uneasiness on his account, she supposed that he was
      accustomed to the exercise, and that there was no danger. But whether, in
      swimming, the boy had struck his breast against a sunken rock, or whether
      he was suddenly taken with cramp, or whether he had over-calculated his
      own strength, it so happened, that when he had disembarrassed the little
      plaything from the flags in which it was entangled, and sent it forward on
      its course, he had scarce swam a few yards in his way to the shore, than
      he raised himself suddenly from the water, and screamed aloud, clapping
      his hands at the same time with an expression of fear and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Avenel, instantly taking the alarm, called hastily to the
      attendants to get the boat ready. But this was an affair of some time. The
      only boat permitted to be used on the lake, was moored within the second
      cut which intersected the canal, and it was several minutes ere it could
      be unmoored and got under way. Meantime, the Lady of Avenel, with
      agonizing anxiety, saw that the efforts that the poor boy made to keep
      himself afloat, were now exchanged for a faint struggling, which would
      soon have been over, but for aid equally prompt and unhoped-for. Wolf,
      who, like some of that large species of greyhound, was a practised
      water-dog, had marked the object of her anxiety, and, quitting his
      mistress's side, had sought the nearest point from which he could with
      safety plunge into the lake. With the wonderful instinct which these noble
      animals have so often displayed in the like circumstances, he swam
      straight to the spot where his assistance was so much wanted, and seizing
      the child's under-dress in his mouth, he not only kept him afloat, but
      towed him towards the causeway. The boat having put off with a couple of
      men, met the dog half-way, and relieved him of his burden. They landed on
      the causeway, close by the gates of the castle, with their yet lifeless
      charge, and were there met by the Lady of Avenel, attended by one or two
      of her maidens, eagerly waiting to administer assistance to the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was borne into the castle, deposited upon a bed, and every mode of
      recovery resorted to, which the knowledge of the times, and the skill of
      Henry Warden, who professed some medical science, could dictate. For some
      time it was all in vain, and the Lady watched, with unspeakable
      earnestness, the pallid countenance of the beautiful child. He seemed
      about ten years old. His dress was of the meanest sort, but his long
      curled hair, and the noble cast of his features, partook not of that
      poverty of appearance. The proudest noble in Scotland might have been yet
      prouder could he have called that child his heir. While, with breathless
      anxiety, the Lady of Avenel gazed on his well-formed and expressive
      features, a slight shade of colour returned gradually to the cheek;
      suspended animation became restored by degrees, the child sighed deeply,
      opened his eyes, which to the human countenance produces the effect of
      light upon the natural landscape, stretched his arms towards the Lady, and
      muttered the word &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; that epithet, of all others, which is dearest
      to the female ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, madam,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;has restored the child to your wishes;
      it must be yours so to bring him up, that he may not one day wish that he
      had perished in his innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be my charge,&rdquo; said the Lady; and again throwing her arms around
      the boy, she overwhelmed him with kisses and caresses, so much was she
      agitated by the terror arising from the danger in which he had been just
      placed, and by joy at his unexpected deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not my mother,&rdquo; said the boy, recovering his recollection,
      and endeavouring, though faintly, to escape from the caresses of the Lady
      of Avenel; &ldquo;you are not my mother,&mdash;alas! I have no mother&mdash;only
      I have dreamt that I had one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will read the dream for you, my love,&rdquo; answered the Lady of Avenel;
      &ldquo;and I will be myself your mother. Surely God has heard my wishes, and, in
      his own marvellous manner, hath sent me an object on which my affections
      may expand themselves.&rdquo; She looked towards Warden as she spoke. The
      preacher hesitated what he should reply to a burst of passionate feeling,
      which, perhaps, seemed to him more enthusiastic than the occasion
      demanded. In the meanwhile, the large stag-hound, Wolf, which, dripping
      wet as he was, had followed his mistress into the apartment, and had sat
      by the bedside, a patient and quiet spectator of all the means used for
      resuscitation of the being whom he had preserved, now became impatient of
      remaining any longer unnoticed, and began to whine and fawn upon the Lady
      with his great rough paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;good Wolf, and you shall be remembered also for your
      day's work; and I will think the more of you for having preserved the life
      of a creature so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Wolf was not quite satisfied with the share of attention which he thus
      attracted; he persisted in whining and pawing upon his mistress, his
      caresses rendered still more troublesome by his long shaggy hair being so
      much and thoroughly wetted, till she desired one of the domestics, with
      whom he was familiar, to call the animal out of the apartment. Wolf
      resisted every invitation to this purpose, until his mistress positively
      commanded him to be gone, in an angry tone; when, turning towards the bed
      on which the body still lay, half awake to sensation, half drowned in the
      meanders of fluctuating delirium, he uttered a deep and savage growl,
      curled up his nose and lips, showing his full range of white and sharpened
      teeth, which might have matched those of an actual wolf, and then, turning
      round, sullenly followed the domestic out of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is singular,&rdquo; said the Lady, addressing Warden; &ldquo;the animal is not
      only so good-natured to all, but so particularly fond of children. What
      can ail him at the little fellow whose life he has saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogs,&rdquo; replied the preacher, &ldquo;are but too like the human race in their
      foibles, though their instinct be less erring than the reason of poor
      mortal man when relying upon his own unassisted powers. Jealousy, my good
      lady, is a passion not unknown to them, and they often evince it, not only
      with respect to the preferences which they see given by their masters to
      individuals of their own species, but even when their rivals are children.
      You have caressed that child much and eagerly, and the dog considers
      himself as a discarded favourite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a strange instinct,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;and from the gravity with
      which you mention it, my reverend friend, I would almost say that you
      supposed this singular jealousy of my favourite Wolf, was not only well
      founded, but justifiable. But perhaps you speak in jest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom jest,&rdquo; answered the preacher; &ldquo;life was not lent to us to be
      expended in that idle mirth which resembles the crackling of thorns under
      the pot. I would only have you derive, if it so please you, this lesson
      from what I have said, that the best of our feelings, when indulged to
      excess, may give pain to others. There is but one in which we may indulge
      to the utmost limit of vehemence of which our bosom is capable, secure
      that excess cannot exist in the greatest intensity to which it can be
      excited&mdash;I mean the love of our Maker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, &ldquo;we are commanded by the same authority
      to love our neighbour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; said Warden, &ldquo;but our love to God is to be unbounded&mdash;we
      are to love him with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole
      strength. The love which the precept commands us to bear to our neighbour,
      has affixed to it a direct limit and qualification&mdash;we are to love
      our neighbour as ourself; as it is elsewhere explained by the great
      commandment, that we must do unto him as we would that he should do unto
      us. Here there is a limit, and a bound, even to the most praiseworthy of
      our affections, so far as they are turned upon sublunary and terrestrial
      objects. We are to render to our neighbour, whatever be his rank or
      degree, that corresponding portion of affection with which we could
      rationally expect we should ourselves be regarded by those standing in the
      same relation to us. Hence, neither husband nor wife, neither son nor
      daughter, neither friend nor relation, are lawfully to be made the objects
      of our idolatry. The Lord our God is a jealous God, and will not endure
      that we bestow on the creature that extremity of devotion which He who
      made us demands as his own share. I say to you, Lady, that even in the
      fairest, and purest, and most honourable feelings of our nature, there is
      that original taint of sin which ought to make us pause and hesitate, ere
      we indulge them to excess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand not this, reverend sir,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;nor do I guess what
      I can have now said or done, to draw down on me an admonition which has
      something a taste of reproof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Warden, &ldquo;I crave your pardon, if I have urged aught beyond
      the limits of my duty. But consider, whether in the sacred promise to be
      not only a protectress, but a mother, to this poor child, your purpose may
      meet the wishes of the noble knight your husband. The fondness which you
      have lavished on the unfortunate, and, I own, most lovely child, has met
      something like a reproof in the bearing of your household dog.&mdash;Displease
      not your noble husband. Men, as well as animals, are jealous of the
      affections of those they love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too much, reverend sir,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, greatly
      offended. &ldquo;You have been long our guest, and have received from the Knight
      of Avenel and myself that honour and regard which your character and
      profession so justly demand. But I am yet to learn that we have at any
      time authorized your interference in our family arrangements, or placed
      you as a judge of our conduct towards each other. I pray this may be
      forborne in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; replied the preacher, with the boldness peculiar to the clergy of
      his persuasion at that time, &ldquo;when you weary of my admonitions&mdash;when
      I see that my services are no longer acceptable to you, and the noble
      knight your husband, I shall know that my Master wills me no longer to
      abide here; and, praying for a continuance of his best blessings on your
      family I will then, were the season the depth of winter, and the hour
      midnight, walk out on yonder waste, and travel forth through these wild
      mountains, as lonely and unaided, though far more helpless, than when I
      first met your husband in the valley of Glendearg. But while I remain
      here, I will not see you err from the true path, no, not a hair's-breadth,
      without making the old man's voice and remonstrance heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the Lady, who both loved and respected the good man,
      though sometimes a little offended at what she conceived to be an
      exuberant degree of zeal, &ldquo;we will not part this way, my good friend.
      Women are quick and hasty in their feelings; but, believe me, my wishes
      and my purposes towards this child are such as both my husband and you
      will approve of.&rdquo; The clergyman bowed, and retreated to his own apartment.

  How steadfastly he fix'd his eyes on me&mdash;
  His dark eyes shining through forgotten tears&mdash;
  Then stretch'd his little arms, and call'd me mother!

</pre>
    <p>
      When Warden had left the apartment, the Lady of Avenel gave way to the
      feelings of tenderness which the sight of the boy, his sudden danger, and
      his recent escape, had inspired; and no longer awed by the sternness, as
      she deemed it, of the preacher, heaped with caresses the lovely and
      interesting child. He was now, in some measure, recovered from the
      consequences of his accident, and received passively, though not without
      wonder, the tokens of kindness with which he was thus loaded. The face of
      the lady was strange to him, and her dress different and far more
      sumptuous than any he remembered. But the boy was naturally of an
      undaunted temper; and indeed children are generally acute physiognomists,
      and not only pleased by that which is beautiful in itself, but peculiarly
      quick in distinguishing and replying to the attentions of those who really
      love them. If they see a person in company, though a perfect stranger, who
      is by nature fond of children, the little imps seem to discover it by a
      sort of free-masonry, while the awkward attempts of those who make
      advances to them for the purpose of recommending themselves to the
      parents, usually fail in attracting their reciprocal attention. The little
      boy, therefore, appeared in some degree sensible of the lady's caresses,
      and it was with difficulty she withdrew herself from his pillow, to afford
      him leisure for necessary repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom belongs our little rescued varlet?&rdquo; was the first question which
      the Lady of Avenel put to her handmaiden Lilias, when they had retired to
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To an old woman in the hamlet,&rdquo; said Lilias, &ldquo;who is even now come so far
      as the porter's lodge to inquire concerning his safety. Is it your
      pleasure that she be admitted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it my pleasure?&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, echoing the question with a
      strong accent of displeasure and surprise; &ldquo;can you make any doubt of it?
      What woman but must pity the agony of the mother, whose heart is throbbing
      for the safety of a child so lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, madam,&rdquo; said Lilias, &ldquo;this woman is too old to be the mother of
      the child; I rather think she must be his grandmother, or some more
      distant relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be she who she will, Lilias,&rdquo; replied the Lady, &ldquo;she must have an aching
      heart while the safety of a creature so lovely is uncertain. Go instantly
      and bring her hither. Besides, I would willingly learn something
      concerning his birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias left the hall, and presently afterwards returned, ushering in a
      tall female very poorly dressed, yet with more pretension to decency and
      cleanliness than was usually combined with such coarse garments. The Lady
      of Avenel knew her figure the instant she presented herself. It was the
      fashion of the family, that upon every Sabbath, and on two evenings in the
      week besides, Henry Warden preached or lectured in the chapel at the
      castle. The extension of the Protestant faith was, upon principle, as well
      as in good policy, a primary object with the Knight of Avenel. The
      inhabitants of the village were therefore invited to attend upon the
      instructions of Henry Warden, and many of them were speedily won to the
      doctrine which their master and protector approved. These sermons,
      homilies, and lectures, had made a great impression on the mind of the
      Abbot Eustace, or Eustatius, and were a sufficient spur to the severity
      and sharpness of his controversy with his old fellow-collegiate; and, ere
      Queen Mary was dethroned, and while the Catholics still had considerable
      authority in the Border provinces, he more than once threatened to levy
      his vassals, and assail and level with the earth that stronghold of heresy
      the Castle of Avenel. But notwithstanding the Abbot's impotent resentment,
      and notwithstanding also the disinclination of the country to favour the
      new religion, Henry Warden proceeded without remission in his labours, and
      made weekly converts from the faith of Rome to that of the reformed
      church. Amongst those who gave most earnest and constant attendance on his
      ministry, was the aged woman, whose form, tall, and otherwise too
      remarkable to be forgotten, the Lady had of late observed frequently as
      being conspicuous among the little audience. She had indeed more than once
      desired to know who that stately-looking woman was, whose appearance was
      so much above the poverty of her vestments. But the reply had always been,
      that she was an Englishwoman, who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet,
      and that no one knew more concerning her. She now asked her after her name
      and birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magdalen Graeme is my name,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;I come of the Graemes of
      Heathergill, in Nicol Forest, [Footnote: A district of Cumberland, lying
      close to the Scottish border.] a people of ancient blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what make you,&rdquo; continued the Lady, &ldquo;so far distant from your home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no home,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;it was burnt by your
      Border-riders&mdash;my husband and my son were slain&mdash;there is not a
      drop's blood left in the veins of any one which is of kin to mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no uncommon fate in these wild times, and in this unsettled
      land,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;the English hands have been as deeply dyed in our
      blood as ever those of Scotsmen have been in yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have right to say it, Lady,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;for men tell
      of a time when this castle was not strong enough to save your father's
      life, or to afford your mother and her infant a place of refuge. And why
      ask ye me, then, wherefore I dwell not in mine own home, and with mine own
      people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was indeed an idle question,&rdquo; answered the Lady, &ldquo;where misery so
      often makes wanderers; but wherefore take refuge in a hostile country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My neighbours were Popish and mass-mongers,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;it has
      pleased Heaven to give me a clearer sight of the gospel, and I have
      tarried here to enjoy the ministry of that worthy man Henry Warden, who,
      to the praise and comfort of many, teacheth the Evangel in truth and in
      sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you poor?&rdquo; again demanded the Lady of Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me ask alms of no one,&rdquo; answered the Englishwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a pause. The manner of the woman was, if not disrespectful,
      at least much less than gracious; and she appeared to give no
      encouragement to farther communication. The Lady of Avenel renewed the
      conversation on a different topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of the danger in which your boy has been placed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, Lady, and how by an especial providence he was rescued from
      death. May Heaven make him thankful, and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What relation do you bear to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his grandmother, lady, if it so please you; the only relation he
      hath left upon earth to take charge of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The burden of his maintenance must necessarily be grievous to you in your
      deserted situation?&rdquo; pursued the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have complained of it to no one,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme, with the same
      unmoved, dry, and unconcerned tone of voice, in which she had answered all
      the former questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, &ldquo;your grandchild could be received into a
      noble family, would it not advantage both him and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Received into a noble family!&rdquo; said the old woman, drawing herself up,
      and bending her brows until her forehead was wrinkled into a frown of
      unusual severity; &ldquo;and for what purpose, I pray you?&mdash;to be my lady's
      page, or my lord's jackman, to eat broken victuals, and contend with other
      menials for the remnants of the master's meal? Would you have him to fan
      the flies from my lady's face while she sleeps, to carry her train while
      she walks, to hand her trencher when she feeds, to ride before her on
      horseback, to walk after her on foot, to sing when she lists, and to be
      silent when she bids?&mdash;a very weathercock, which, though furnished in
      appearance with wings and plumage, cannot soar into the air&mdash;cannot
      fly from the spot where it is perched, but receives all its impulse, and
      performs all its revolutions, obedient to the changeful breath of a vain
      woman? When the eagle of Helvellyn perches on the tower of Lanercost, and
      turns and changes his place to show how the wind sits, Roland Graeme shall
      be what you would make him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman spoke with a rapidity and vehemence which seemed to have in it a
      touch of insanity; and a sudden sense of the danger to which the child
      must necessarily be exposed in the charge of such a keeper, increased the
      Lady's desire to keep him in the castle if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake me, dame,&rdquo; she said, addressing the old woman in a soothing
      manner; &ldquo;I do not wish your boy to be in attendance on myself, but upon
      the good knight my husband. Were he himself the son of a belted earl, he
      could not better be trained to arms, and all that befits a gentleman, than
      by the instructions and discipline of Sir Halbert Glendinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered the old woman, in the same style of bitter irony, &ldquo;I know
      the wages of that service;&mdash;a curse when the corslet is not
      sufficiently brightened,&mdash;a blow when the girth is not tightly drawn,&mdash;to
      be beaten because the hounds are at fault,&mdash;to be reviled because the
      foray is unsuccessful,&mdash;to stain his hands for the master's bidding
      in the blood alike of beast and of man,&mdash;to be a butcher of harmless
      deer, a murderer and defacer of God's own image, not at his own pleasure,
      but at that of his lord,&mdash;to live a brawling ruffian, and a common
      stabber&mdash;exposed to heat, to cold, to want of food, to all the
      privations of an anchoret, not for the love of God, but for the service of
      Satan,&mdash;to die by the gibbet, or in some obscure skirmish,&mdash;to
      sleep out his brief life in carnal security, and to awake in the eternal
      fire, which is never quenched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, &ldquo;but to such unhallowed course of life
      your grandson will not be here exposed. My husband is just and kind to
      those who live under his banner; and you yourself well know, that youth
      have here a strict as well as a good preceptor in the person of our
      chaplain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman appeared to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have named,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the only circumstance which can move me. I
      must soon onward, the vision has said it&mdash;I must not tarry in the
      same spot&mdash;I must on,&mdash;I must on, it is my weird.&mdash;Swear,
      then, that you will protect the boy as if he were your own, until I return
      hither and claim him, and I will consent for a space to part with him. But
      especially swear, he shall not lack the instruction of the godly man who
      hath placed the gospel-truth high above those idolatrous shavelings, the
      monks and friars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, dame,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel; &ldquo;the boy shall have as much
      care as if he were born of my own blood. Will you see him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the old woman sternly; &ldquo;to part is enough. I go forth on my
      own mission. I will not soften my heart by useless tears and wailings, as
      one that is not called to a duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not accept of something to aid you in your pilgrimage?&rdquo; said the
      Lady of Avenel, putting into her hands two crowns of the sun. The old
      woman flung them down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I of the race of Cain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;proud Lady, that you offer me gold
      in exchange for my own flesh and blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no such meaning,&rdquo; said the Lady, gently; &ldquo;nor am I the proud woman
      you term me. Alas! my own fortunes might have taught me humility, even had
      it not been born with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman seemed somewhat to relax her tone of severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are of gentle blood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;else we had not parleyed thus long
      together.&mdash;You are of gentle blood, and to such,&rdquo; she added, drawing
      up her tall form as she spoke, &ldquo;pride is as graceful as is the plume upon
      the bonnet. But for these pieces of gold, lady, you must needs resume
      them. I need not money. I am well provided; and I may not care for myself,
      nor think how, or by whom, I shall be sustained. Farewell, and keep your
      word. Cause your gates to be opened, and your bridges to be lowered. I
      will set forward this very night. When I come again, I will demand from
      you a strict account, for I have left with you the jewel of my life! Sleep
      will visit me but in snatches, food will not refresh me, rest will not
      restore my strength, until I see Roland Graeme. Once more, farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your obeisance, dame,&rdquo; said Lilias to Magdalen Graeme, as she
      retired, &ldquo;make your obeisance to her ladyship, and thank her for her
      goodness, as is but fitting and right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman turned short around on the officious waiting-maid. &ldquo;Let her
      make her obeisance to me then, and I will return it. Why should I bend to
      her?&mdash;is it because her kirtle is of silk, and mine of blue lockeram?&mdash;Go
      to, my lady's waiting-woman. Know that the rank of the man rates that of
      the wife, and that she who marries a churl's son, were she a king's
      daughter, is but a peasant's bride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias was about to reply in great indignation, but her mistress imposed
      silence on her, and commanded that the old woman should be safely
      conducted to the mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conduct her safe!&rdquo; exclaimed the incensed waiting-woman, while Magdalen
      Graeme left the apartment; &ldquo;I say, duck her in the loch, and then we will
      see whether she is witch or not, as every body in the village of Lochside
      will say and swear. I marvel your ladyship could bear so long with her
      insolence.&rdquo; But the commands of the Lady were obeyed, and the old dame,
      dismissed from the castle, was committed to her fortune. She kept her
      word, and did not long abide in that place, leaving the hamlet on the very
      night succeeding the interview, and wandering no one asked whither. The
      Lady of Avenel inquired under what circumstances she had appeared among
      them, but could only learn that she was believed to be the widow of some
      man of consequence among the Graemes who then inhabited the Debateable
      Land, a name given to a certain portion of territory which was the
      frequent subject of dispute betwixt Scotland and England&mdash;that she
      had suffered great wrong in some of the frequent forays by which that
      unfortunate district was wasted, and had been driven from her
      dwelling-place. She had arrived in the hamlet no one knew for what
      purpose, and was held by some to be a witch, by others a zealous
      Protestant, and by others again a Catholic devotee. Her language was
      mysterious, and her manners repulsive; and all that could be collected
      from her conversation seemed to imply that she was under the influence
      either of a spell or of a vow,&mdash;there was no saying which, since she
      talked as one who acted under a powerful and external agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the particulars which the Lady's inquiries were able to collect
      concerning Magdalen Graeme, being far too meagre and contradictory to
      authorize any satisfactory deduction. In truth, the miseries of the time,
      and the various turns of fate incidental to a frontier country, were
      perpetually chasing from their habitations those who had not the means of
      defence or protection. These wanderers in the land were too often seen, to
      excite much attention or sympathy. They received the cold relief which was
      extorted by general feelings of humanity; a little excited in some
      breasts, and perhaps rather chilled in others, by the recollection that
      they who gave the charity to-day might themselves want it to-morrow.
      Magdalen Graeme, therefore, came and departed like a shadow from the
      neighbourhood of Avenel Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy whom Providence, as she thought, had thus strangely placed under
      her care, was at once established a favourite with the Lady of the castle.
      How could it be otherwise? He became the object of those affectionate
      feelings, which, finding formerly no object on which to expand themselves,
      had increased the gloom of the castle, and imbittered the solitude of its
      mistress. To teach him reading and writing as far as her skill went, to
      attend to his childish comforts, to watch his boyish sports, became the
      Lady's favourite amusement. In her circumstances, where the ear only heard
      the lowing of the cattle from the distant hills, or the heavy step of the
      warder as he walked upon his post, or the half-envied laugh of her maiden
      as she turned her wheel, the appearance of the blooming and beautiful boy
      gave an interest which can hardly be conceived by those who live amid
      gayer and busier scenes. Young Roland was to the Lady of Avenel what the
      flower, which occupies the window of some solitary captive, is to the poor
      wight by whom it is nursed and cultivated,&mdash;something which at once
      excited and repaid her care; and in giving the boy her affection, she
      felt, as it were, grateful to him for releasing her from the state of dull
      apathy in which she had usually found herself during the absence of Sir
      Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the charms of this blooming favourite were unable to chase the
      recurring apprehensions which arose from her husband's procrastinated
      return. Soon after Roland Graeme became a resident at the castle, a groom,
      despatched by Sir Halbert, brought tidings that business still delayed the
      Knight at the Court of Holyrood. The more distant period which the
      messenger had assigned for his master's arrival at length glided away,
      summer melted into autumn, and autumn was about to give place to winter,
      and yet he came not.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The waning harvest-moon shone broad and bright,
 The warder's horn was heard at dead of night,
 And while the portals-wide were flung,
 With trampling hoofs the rocky pavement rung.
                                         LEYDEN.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too, would be a soldier, Roland?&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel to her
      young charge, while, seated on a stone chair at one end of the
      battlements, she saw the boy attempt, with a long stick, to mimic the
      motions of the warder, as he alternately shouldered, or ported, or sloped
      pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lady,&rdquo; said the boy,&mdash;for he was now familiar, and replied to
      her questions with readiness and alacrity,-&ldquo;a soldier will I be; for there
      ne'er was gentleman but who belted him with the brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou a gentleman!&rdquo; said Lilias, who, as usual, was in attendance; &ldquo;such a
      gentleman as I would make of a bean-cod with a rusty knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, chide him not, Lilias,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel, &ldquo;for, beshrew me,
      but I think he comes of gentle blood&mdash;see how it musters in his face
      at your injurious reproof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I my will, madam,&rdquo; answered Lilias, &ldquo;a good birchen wand should make
      his colour muster to better purpose still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word, Lilias,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;one would think you had received
      harm from the poor boy&mdash;or is he so far on the frosty side of your
      favour because he enjoys the sunny side of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over heavens forbode, my Lady!&rdquo; answered Lilias; &ldquo;I have lived too long
      with gentles, I praise my stars for it, to fight with either follies or
      fantasies, whether they relate to beast, bird, or boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias was a favourite in her own class, a spoiled domestic, and often
      accustomed to take more licence than her mistress was at all times willing
      to encourage. But what did not please the Lady of Avenel, she did not
      choose to hear, and thus it was on the present occasion. She resolved to
      look more close and sharply after the boy, who had hitherto been committed
      chiefly to the management of Lilias. He must, she thought, be born of
      gentle blood; it were shame to think otherwise of a form so noble, and
      features so fair;&mdash;the very wildness in which he occasionally
      indulged, his contempt of danger, and impatience of restraint, had in them
      something noble;&mdash;assuredly the child was born of high rank. Such was
      her conclusion, and she acted upon it accordingly. The domestics around
      her, less jealous, or less scrupulous than Lilias, acted as servants
      usually do, following the bias, and flattering, for their own purposes,
      the humour of the Lady; and the boy soon took on him those airs of
      superiority, which the sight of habitual deference seldom fails to
      inspire. It seemed, in truth, as if to command were his natural sphere, so
      easily did he use himself to exact and receive compliance with his
      humours. The chaplain, indeed, might have interposed to check the air of
      assumption which Roland Graeme so readily indulged, and most probably
      would have willingly rendered him that favour; but the necessity of
      adjusting with his brethren some disputed points of church discipline had
      withdrawn him for some time from the castle, and detained him in a distant
      part of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters stood thus in the castle of Avenel, when a winded bugle sent its
      shrill and prolonged notes from the shore of the lake, and was replied to
      cheerily by the signal of the warder. The Lady of Avenel knew the sounds
      of her husband, and rushed to the window of the apartment in which she was
      sitting. A band of about thirty spearmen, with a pennon displayed before
      them, winded along the indented shores of the lake, and approached the
      causeway. A single horseman rode at the head of the party, his bright arms
      catching a glance of the October sun as he moved steadily along. Even at
      that distance, the Lady recognized the lofty plume, bearing the mingled
      colours of her own liveries and those of Glendonwyne, blended with the
      holly-branch; and the firm seat and dignified demeanour of the rider,
      joined to the stately motion of the dark-brown steed, sufficiently
      announced Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady's first thought was that of rapturous joy at her husband's return&mdash;her
      second was connected with a fear which had sometimes intruded itself, that
      he might not altogether approve the peculiar distinction with which she
      had treated her orphan ward. In this fear there was implied a
      consciousness, that the favour she had shown him was excessive; for
      Halbert Glendinning was at least as gentle and indulgent, as he was firm
      and rational in the intercourse of his household; and to her in
      particular, his conduct had ever been most affectionately tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she did fear, that, on the present occasion, her conduct might incur
      Sir Halbert's censure; and hastily resolving that she would not mention,
      the anecdote of the boy until the next day, she ordered him to be
      withdrawn from the apartment by Lilias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go with Lilias, madam,&rdquo; answered the spoiled child, who had
      more than once carried his point by perseverance, and who, like his
      betters, delighted in the exercise of such authority,&mdash;&ldquo;I will not go
      to Lilias's gousty room&mdash;I will stay and see that brave warrior who
      comes riding so gallantly along the drawbridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not stay, Roland,&rdquo; said the Lady, more positively than she
      usually spoke to her little favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; reiterated the boy, who had already felt his consequence, and
      the probable chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i>, Roland!&rdquo; answered the Lady, &ldquo;what manner of word is
      that? I tell you, you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will</i>,&rdquo; answered the forward boy, &ldquo;is a word for a man, and <i>must</i>
      is no word for a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are saucy, sirrah,&rdquo; said the Lady&mdash;&ldquo;Lilias, take him with you
      instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; said Lilias, smiling, as she seized the reluctant boy
      by the arm, &ldquo;that my young master must give place to my old one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too, are malapert, mistress!&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;hath the moon
      changed, that ye all of you thus forget yourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias made no reply, but led off the boy, who, too proud to offer
      unavailing resistance, darted at his benefactress a glance, which
      intimated plainly, how willingly he would have defied her authority, had
      he possessed the power to make good his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Avenel was vexed to find how much this trifling circumstance
      had discomposed her, at the moment when she ought naturally to have been
      entirely engrossed by her husband's return. But we do not recover
      composure by the mere feeling that agitation is mistimed. The glow of
      displeasure had not left the Lady's cheek, her ruffled deportment was not
      yet entirely composed, when her husband, unhelmeted, but still wearing the
      rest of his arms, entered the apartment. His appearance banished the
      thoughts of every thing else; she rushed to him, clasped his iron-sheathed
      frame in her arms, and kissed his martial and manly face with an affection
      which was at once evident and sincere. The warrior returned her embrace
      and her caress with the same fondness; for the time which had passed since
      their union had diminished its romantic ardour, perhaps, but it had rather
      increased its rational tenderness, and Sir Halbert Glendinning's long and
      frequent absences from his castle had prevented affection from
      degenerating by habit into indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first eager greetings were paid and received, the Lady gazed
      fondly on her husband's face as she remarked, &ldquo;You are altered, Halbert&mdash;you
      have ridden hard and far to-day, or you have been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been well, Mary,&rdquo; answered the Knight, &ldquo;passing well have I been;
      and a long ride is to me, thou well knowest, but a thing of constant
      custom. Those who are born noble may slumber out their lives within the
      walls of their castles and manor-houses; but he who hath achieved nobility
      by his own deeds must ever be in the saddle, to show that he merits his
      advancement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke thus, the Lady gazed fondly on him, as if endeavouring to
      read his inmost soul; for the tone in which he spoke was that of
      melancholy depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Halbert Glendinning was the same, yet a different person from what he
      had appeared in his early years. The fiery freedom of the aspiring youth
      had given place to the steady and stern composure of the approved soldier
      and skilful politician. There were deep traces of care on those noble
      features, over which each emotion used formerly to pass, like light clouds
      across a summer sky. That sky was now, not perhaps clouded, but still and
      grave, like that of the sober autumn evening. The forehead was higher and
      more bare than in early youth, and the locks which still clustered thick
      and dark on the warrior's head, were worn away at the temples, not by age,
      but by the constant pressure of the steel cap, or helmet. His beard,
      according to the fashion of the time, grew short and thick, and was turned
      into mustaches on the upper lip, and peaked at the extremity. The cheek,
      weather-beaten and embrowned, had lost the glow of youth, but showed the
      vigorous complexion of active and confirmed manhood. Halbert Glendinning
      was, in a word, a knight to ride at a king's right hand, to bear his
      banner in war, and to be his counsellor in time of peace; for his looks
      expressed the considerate firmness which can resolve wisely and dare
      boldly. Still, over these noble features, there now spread an air of
      dejection, of which, perhaps, the owner was not conscious, but which did
      not escape the observation of his anxious and affectionate partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened, or is about to happen,&rdquo; said the Lady of Avenel;
      &ldquo;this sadness sits not on your brow without cause&mdash;misfortune,
      national or particular, must needs be at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing new that I wot of,&rdquo; said Halbert Glendinning; &ldquo;but there
      is little of evil which can befall a kingdom, that may not be apprehended
      in this unhappy and divided realm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;I see there hath really been some fatal work
      on foot. My Lord of Murray has not so long detained you at Holyrood, save
      that he wanted your help in some weighty purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been at Holyrood, Mary,&rdquo; answered the Knight; &ldquo;I have been
      several weeks abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abroad! and sent me no word?&rdquo; replied the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would the knowledge have availed, but to have rendered you unhappy,
      my love?&rdquo; replied the Knight; &ldquo;your thoughts would have converted the
      slightest breeze that curled your own lake, into a tempest raging in the
      German ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you then really crossed the sea?&rdquo; said the Lady, to whom the
      very idea of an element which she had never seen conveyed notions of
      terror and of wonder,&mdash;&ldquo;really left your own native land, and trodden
      distant shores, where the Scottish tongue is unheard and unknown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, and really,&rdquo; said the Knight, taking her hand in affectionate
      playfulness, &ldquo;I have done this marvellous deed&mdash;have rolled on the
      ocean for three days and three nights, with the deep green waves dashing
      by the side of my pillow, and but a thin plank to divide me from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my Halbert,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;that was a tempting of Divine
      Providence. I never bade you unbuckle the sword from your side, or lay the
      lance from your hand&mdash;I never bade you sit still when your honour
      called you to rise and ride; but are not blade and spear dangers enough
      for one man's life, and why would you trust rough waves and raging seas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have in Germany, and in the Low Countries, as they are called,&rdquo;
       answered Glendinning, &ldquo;men who are united with us in faith, and with whom
      it is fitting we should unite in alliance. To some of these I was
      despatched on business as important as it was secret. I went in safety,
      and I returned in security; there is more danger to a man's life betwixt
      this and Holyrood, than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands of
      Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the country, my Halbert, and the people,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;are they
      like our kindly Scots? or what bearing have they to strangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a people, Mary, strong in their wealth, which renders all other
      nations weak, and weak in those arts of war by which other nations are
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hollander and the Fleming, Mary, pour forth their spirit in trade,
      and not in war; their wealth purchases them the arms of foreign soldiers,
      by whose aid they defend it. They erect dikes on the sea-shore to protect
      the land which they have won, and they levy regiments of the stubborn
      Switzers and hardy Germans to protect the treasures which they have
      amassed. And thus they are strong in their weakness; for the very wealth
      which tempts their masters to despoil them, arms strangers in their
      behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slothful hinds!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary, thinking and feeling like a
      Scotswoman of the period; &ldquo;have they hands, and fight not for the land
      which bore them? They should be notched off at the elbow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that were but hard justice,&rdquo; answered her husband; &ldquo;for their hands
      serve their country, though not in battle, like ours. Look at these barren
      hills, Mary, and at that deep winding vale by which the cattle are even
      now returning from their scanty browse. The hand of the industrious
      Fleming would cover these mountains with wood, and raise corn where we now
      see a starved and scanty sward of heath and ling. It grieves me, Mary,
      when I look on that land, and think what benefit it might receive from
      such men as I have lately seen&mdash;men who seek not the idle fame
      derived from dead ancestors, or the bloody renown won in modern broils,
      but tread along the land, as preservers and improvers, not as tyrants and
      destroyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These amendments would here be but a vain fancy, my Halbert,&rdquo; answered
      the Lady of Avenel; &ldquo;the trees would be burned by the English foemen, ere
      they ceased to be shrubs, and the grain that you raised would be gathered
      in by the first neighbour that possessed more riders than follow your
      train. Why should you repine at this? The fate that made you Scotsman by
      birth, gave you head, and heart, and hand, to uphold the name as it must
      needs be upheld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gave <i>me</i> no name to uphold,&rdquo; said Halbert, pacing the floor
      slowly; &ldquo;my arm has been foremost in every strife&mdash;my voice has been
      heard in every council, nor have the wisest rebuked me. The crafty
      Lethington, the deep and dark Morton, have held secret council with me,
      and Grange and Lindsay have owned, that in the field I did the devoir of a
      gallant knight&mdash;but let the emergence be passed when they need my
      head and hand, and they only know me as son of the obscure portioner of
      Glendearg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a theme which the Lady always dreaded; for the rank conferred on
      her husband, the favour in which he was held by the powerful Earl of
      Murray, and the high talents by which he vindicated his right to that rank
      and that favour, were qualities which rather increased than diminished the
      envy which was harboured against Sir Halbert Glendinning among a proud
      aristocracy, as a person originally of inferior and obscure birth, who had
      risen to his present eminence solely by his personal merit. The natural
      firmness of his mind did not enable him to despise the ideal advantages of
      a higher pedigree, which were held in such universal esteem by all with
      whom he conversed; and so open are the noblest minds to jealous
      inconsistencies, that there were moments in which he felt mortified that
      his lady should possess those advantages of birth and high descent which
      he himself did not enjoy, and regretted that his importance as the
      proprietor of Avenel was qualified by his possessing it only as the
      husband of the heiress. He was not so unjust as to permit any unworthy
      feelings to retain permanent possession of his mind, but yet they recurred
      from time to time, and did not escape his lady's anxious observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we been blessed with children,&rdquo; she was wont on such occasions to say
      to herself, &ldquo;had our blood been united in a son who might have joined my
      advantages of descent with my husband's personal worth, these painful and
      irksome reflections had not disturbed our union even for a moment. But the
      existence of such an heir, in whom our affections, as well as our
      pretensions, might have centred, has been denied to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such mutual feelings, it cannot be wondered that it gave the Lady
      pain to hear her husband verging towards this topic of mutual discontent.
      On the present, as on other similar occasions, she endeavoured to divert
      the knight's thoughts from this painful channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;suffer yourself to dwell upon things which
      profit nothing? Have you indeed no name to uphold? You, the good and the
      brave, the wise in council, and the strong in battle, have you not to
      support the reputation your own deeds have won, a reputation more
      honourable than mere ancestry can supply? Good men love and honour you,
      the wicked fear, and the turbulent obey you; and is it not necessary you
      should exert yourself to ensure the endurance of that love, that honour,
      and wholesome fear, and that necessary obedience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she thus spoke, the eye of her husband caught from hers courage and
      comfort, and it lightened as he took her hand and replied, &ldquo;It is most
      true, my Mary, and I deserve thy rebuke, who forget what I am, in repining
      because I am not what I cannot be. I am now what the most famed ancestors
      of those I envy were, the mean man raised into eminence by his own
      exertions; and sure it is a boast as honourable to have those capacities
      which are necessary to the foundation of a family, as to be descended from
      one who possessed them some centuries before. The Hay of Loncarty, who
      bequeathed his bloody yoke to his lineage,&mdash;the 'dark gray man,' who
      first founded the house of Douglas, had yet less of ancestry to boast than
      I have. For thou knowest, Mary, that my name derives itself from a line of
      ancient warriors, although my immediate forefathers preferred the humble
      station in which thou didst first find them; and war and counsel are not
      less proper to the house of Glendonwyne, even, in its most remote
      descendants, than to the proudest of their baronage.&rdquo; [Footnote: This was
      a house of ancient descent and superior consequence, including persons who
      fought at Bannockburn and Otterburn, and closely connected by alliance and
      friendship with the great Earls of Douglas. The Knight in this story
      argues as most Scotsmen would do in his situation, for all of the same
      clan are popularly considered as descended from the same stock, and as
      having a right to the ancestral honor of the chief branch. This opinion,
      though sometimes ideal, is so strong even at this day of innovation, that
      it may be observed as a national difference between my countrymen and the
      English. If you ask an Englishman of good birth, whether a person of the
      same name be connected with him, he answers (if <i>in dubio.</i>) &ldquo;No&mdash;he
      is a mere namesake.&rdquo; Ask a similar question of a Scot, (I mean a
      Scotsman,) he replies&mdash;&ldquo;He is one of our clan; I daresay there is a
      relationship, though I do not know how distant.&rdquo; The Englishman thinks of
      discountenancing a species of rivalry in society; the Scotsman's answer is
      grounded on the ancient idea of strengthening the clan.]
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode across the hall as he spoke; and the Lady smiled internally to
      observe how much his mind dwelt upon the prerogatives of birth, and
      endeavoured to establish his claims, however remote, to a share in them,
      at the very moment when he affected to hold them in contempt. It will
      easily be guessed, however, that she permitted no symptom to escape her
      that could show she was sensible of the weakness of her husband, a
      perspicacity which perhaps his proud spirit could not very easily have
      brooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he returned from the extremity of the hall, to which he had stalked
      while in the act of vindicating the title of the house of Glendonwyne in
      its most remote branches to the full privileges of aristocracy, &ldquo;Where,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;is Wolf? I have not seen him since my return, and he was usually
      the first to welcome my home-coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wolf,&rdquo; said the Lady, with a slight degree of embarrassment, for which
      perhaps, she would have found it difficult to assign any reason even to
      herself, &ldquo;Wolf is chained up for the present. He hath been surly to my
      page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wolf chained up&mdash;and Wolf surly to your page!&rdquo; answered Sir Halbert
      Glendinning; &ldquo;Wolf never was surly to any one; and the chain will either
      break his spirit or render him savage&mdash;So ho, there&mdash;set Wolf
      free directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was obeyed; and the huge dog rushed into the hall, disturbing, by his
      unwieldy and boisterous gambols, the whole economy of reels, rocks, and
      distaffs, with which the maidens of the household were employed when the
      arrival of their lord was a signal to them to withdraw, and extracting
      from Lilias, who was summoned to put them again in order, the natural
      observation, &ldquo;That the Laird's pet was as troublesome as the lady's page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is this page, Mary?&rdquo; said the Knight, his attention again called
      to the subject by the observation of the waiting-woman,&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this
      page, whom every one seems to weigh in the balance with my old friend and
      favourite, Wolf?&mdash;When did you aspire to the dignity of keeping a
      page, or who is the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, my Halbert,&rdquo; said the Lady, not without a blush, &ldquo;you will not
      think your wife entitled to less attendance than other ladies of her
      quality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Dame Mary,&rdquo; answered the Knight, &ldquo;it is enough you desire such an
      attendant.&mdash;Yet I have never loved to nurse such useless menials&mdash;a
      lady's page&mdash;it may well suit the proud English dames to have a
      slender youth to bear their trains from bower to hall, fan them when they
      slumber, and touch the lute for them when they please to listen; but our
      Scottish matrons were wont to be above such vanities, and our Scottish
      youth ought to be bred to the spear and the stirrup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, my husband,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;I did but jest when I called this
      boy my page; he is in sooth a little orphan whom we saved from perishing
      in the lake, and whom I have since kept in the castle out of charity.&mdash;Lilias,
      bring little Roland hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland entered accordingly, and, flying to the Lady's side, took hold of
      the plaits of her gown, and then turned round, and gazed with an attention
      not unmingled with fear, upon the stately form of the Knight.&mdash;&ldquo;Roland,&rdquo;
       said the Lady, &ldquo;go kiss the hand of the noble Knight, and ask him to be
      thy protector.&rdquo;&mdash;But Roland obeyed not, and, keeping his station,
      continued to gaze fixedly and timidly on Sir Halbert Glendinning.&mdash;&ldquo;Go
      to the Knight, boy,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;what dost thou fear, child? Go, kiss
      Sir Halbert's hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will kiss no hand save yours, Lady,&rdquo; answered the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but do as you are commanded, child,&rdquo; replied the Lady.&mdash;&ldquo;He is
      dashed by your presence,&rdquo; she said, apologizing to her husband; &ldquo;but is he
      not a handsome boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so is Wolf,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, as he patted his huge four-footed
      favourite, &ldquo;a handsome dog; but he has this double advantage over your new
      favourite, that he does what he is commanded, and hears not when he is
      praised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, now you are displeased with me,&rdquo; replied the Lady; &ldquo;and yet why
      should you be so? There is nothing wrong in relieving the distressed
      orphan, or in loving that which is in itself lovely and deserving of
      affection. But you have seen Mr. Warden at Edinburgh, and he has set you
      against the poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mary,&rdquo; answered her husband, &ldquo;Mr. Warden better knows his place
      than to presume to interfere either in your affairs or mine. I neither
      blame your relieving this boy, nor your kindness for him. But, I think,
      considering his birth and prospects, you ought not to treat him with
      injudicious fondness, which can only end in rendering him unfit for the
      humble situation to which Heaven has designed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, my Halbert, do but look at the boy,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;and see
      whether he has not the air of being intended by Heaven for something
      nobler than a mere peasant. May he not be designed, as others have been,
      to rise out of a humble situation into honour and eminence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far had she proceeded, when the consciousness that she was treading
      upon delicate ground at once occurred to her, and induced her to take the
      most natural, but the worst of all courses in such occasions, whether in
      conversation or in an actual bog, namely, that of stopping suddenly short
      in the illustration which she had commenced. Her brow crimsoned, and that
      of Sir Halbert Glendinning was slightly overcast. But it was only for an
      instant; for he was incapable of mistaking his lady's meaning, or
      supposing that she meant intentional disrespect to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it as you please, my love,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I owe you too much to
      contradict you in aught which may render your solitary mode of life more
      endurable. Make of this youth what you will, and you have my full
      authority for doing so. But remember he is your charge, not mine&mdash;remember
      he hath limbs to do man's service, a soul and a tongue to worship God;
      breed him, therefore, to be true to his country and to Heaven; and for the
      rest, dispose of him as you list&mdash;it is, and shall rest, your own
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation decided the fate of Roland Graeme, who from
      thence-forward was little noticed by the master of the mansion of Avenel,
      but indulged and favoured by its mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      This situation led to many important consequences, and, in truth, tended
      to bring forth the character of the youth in all its broad lights and deep
      shadows. As the Knight himself seemed tacitly to disclaim alike interest
      and control over the immediate favourite of his lady, young Roland was, by
      circumstances, exempted from the strict discipline to which, as the
      retainer of a Scottish man of rank, he would otherwise have been
      subjected, according to all the rigour of the age. But the steward, or
      master of the household&mdash;such was the proud title assumed by the head
      domestic of each petty baron&mdash;deemed it not advisable to interfere
      with the favourite of the Lady, and especially since she had brought the
      estate into the present family. Master Jasper Wingate was a man
      experienced, as he often boasted, in the ways of great families, and knew
      how to keep the steerage even when the wind and tide chanced to be in
      contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prudent personage winked at much, and avoided giving opportunity for
      farther offence, by requesting little of Roland Graeme beyond the degree
      of attention which he was himself disposed to pay; rightly conjecturing,
      that however lowly the place which the youth might hold in the favour of
      the Knight of Avenel, still to make an evil report of him would make an
      enemy of the Lady, without securing the favour of her husband. With these
      prudential considerations, and doubtless not without an eye to his own
      ease and convenience, he taught the boy as much, and only as much, as he
      chose to learn, readily admitting whatever apology it pleased his pupil to
      allege in excuse for idleness or negligence. As the other persons in the
      castle, to whom such tasks were delegated, readily imitated the prudential
      conduct of the major-domo, there was little control used towards Roland
      Graeme, who, of course, learned no more than what a very active mind, and
      a total impatience of absolute idleness led him to acquire upon his own
      account, and by dint of his own exertions. The latter were especially
      earnest, when the Lady herself condescended to be his tutress, or to
      examine his progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It followed also from his quality as my Lady's favourite, that Roland was
      viewed with no peculiar good-will by the followers of the Knight, many of
      whom, of the same age, and apparently similar origin, with the fortunate
      page, were subjected to severe observance of the ancient and rigorous
      discipline of a feudal retainer. To these, Roland Graeme was of course an
      object of envy, and, in consequence, of dislike and detraction; but the
      youth possessed qualities which it was impossible to depreciate. Pride,
      and a sense of early ambition, did for him what severity and constant
      instruction did for others. In truth, the youthful Roland displayed that
      early flexibility both of body and mind, which renders exercise, either
      mental or bodily, rather matter of sport than of study; and it seemed as
      if he acquired accidentally, and by starts, those accomplishments, which
      earnest and constant instruction, enforced by frequent reproof and
      occasional chastisement, had taught to others. Such military exercises,
      such lessons of the period, as he found it agreeable or convenient to
      apply to, he learned so perfectly, as to confound those who were ignorant
      how often the want of constant application is compensated by vivacity of
      talent and ardent enthusiasm. The lads, therefore, who were more regularly
      trained to arms, to horsemanship, and to other necessary exercises of the
      period, while they envied Roland Graeme the indulgence or negligence with
      which he seemed to be treated, had little reason to boast of their own
      superior acquirements; a few hours, with the powerful exertion of a most
      energetic will, seemed to do for him more than the regular instruction of
      weeks could accomplish for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these advantages, if, indeed, they were to be termed such, the
      character of young Roland began to develope itself. It was bold,
      peremptory, decisive, and overbearing; generous, if neither withstood nor
      contradicted; vehement and passionate, if censured or opposed. He seemed
      to consider himself as attached to no one, and responsible to no one,
      except his mistress, and even over her mind he had gradually acquired that
      species of ascendancy which indulgence is so apt to occasion. And although
      the immediate followers and dependents of Sir Halbert Glendinning saw his
      ascendancy with jealousy, and often took occasion to mortify his vanity,
      there wanted not those who were willing to acquire the favour of the Lady
      of Avenel by humouring and taking part with the youth whom she protected;
      for although a favourite, as the poet assures us, has no friend, he seldom
      fails to have both followers and flatterers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partisans of Roland Graeme were chiefly to be found amongst the
      inhabitants of the little hamlet on the shore of the lake. These
      villagers, who were sometimes tempted to compare their own situation with
      that of the immediate and constant followers of the Knight, who attended
      him on his frequent journeys to Edinburgh and elsewhere, delighted in
      considering and representing themselves as more properly the subjects of
      the Lady of Avenel than of her husband. It is true, her wisdom and
      affection on all occasions discountenanced the distinction which was here
      implied; but the villagers persisted in thinking it must be agreeable to
      her to enjoy their peculiar and undivided homage, or at least in acting as
      if they thought so; and one chief mode by which they evinced their
      sentiments, was by the respect they paid to young Roland Graeme, the
      favourite attendant of the descendant of their ancient lords. This was a
      mode of flattery too pleasing to encounter rebuke or censure; and the
      opportunity which it afforded the youth to form, as it were, a party of
      his own within the limits of the ancient barony of Avenel, added not a
      little to the audacity and decisive tone of a character, which was by
      nature bold, impetuous, and incontrollable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two members of the household who had manifested an early jealousy
      of Roland Graeme, the prejudices of Wolf were easily overcome; and in
      process of time the noble dog slept with Bran, Luath, and the celebrated
      hounds of ancient days. But Mr. Warden, the chaplain, lived, and retained
      his dislike to the youth. That good man, single-minded and benevolent as
      he really was, entertained rather more than a reasonable idea of the
      respect due to him as a minister, and exacted from the inhabitants of the
      castle more deference than the haughty young page, proud of his mistress's
      favour, and petulant from youth and situation, was at all times willing to
      pay. His bold and free demeanour, his attachment to rich dress and
      decoration, his inaptitude to receive instruction, and his hardening
      himself against rebuke, were circumstances which induced the good old man,
      with more haste than charity, to set the forward page down as a vessel of
      wrath, and to presage that the youth nursed that pride and haughtiness of
      spirit which goes before ruin and destruction. On the other hand, Roland
      evinced at times a marked dislike, and even something like contempt, of
      the chaplain. Most of the attendants and followers of Sir Halbert
      Glendinning entertained the same charitable thoughts as the reverend Mr.
      Warden; but while Roland was favoured by their lady, and endured by their
      lord, they saw no policy in making their opinions public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme was sufficiently sensible of the unpleasant situation in
      which he stood; but in the haughtiness of his heart he retorted upon the
      other domestics the distant, cold, and sarcastic manner in which they
      treated him, assumed an air of superiority which compelled the most
      obstinate to obedience, and had the satisfaction at least to be dreaded,
      if he was heartily hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain's marked dislike had the effect of recommending him to the
      attention of Sir Halbert's brother, Edward, who now, under the conventual
      appellation of Father Ambrose, continued to be one of the few monks who,
      with the Abbot Eustatius, had, notwithstanding the nearly total downfall
      of their faith under the regency of Murray, been still permitted to linger
      in the cloisters at Kennaquhair. Respect to Sir Halbert had prevented
      their being altogether driven out of the Abbey, though their order was now
      in a great measure suppressed, and they were interdicted the public
      exercise of their ritual, and only allowed for their support a small
      pension out of their once splendid revenues. Father Ambrose, thus
      situated, was an occasional, though very rare visitant, at the Castle of
      Avenel, and was at such times observed to pay particular attention to
      Roland Graeme, who seemed to return it with more depth of feeling than
      consisted with his usual habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus situated, years glided on, during which the Knight of Avenel
      continued to act a frequent and important part in the convulsions of his
      distracted country; while young Graeme anticipated, both in wishes and
      personal accomplishments, the age which should enable him to emerge from
      the obscurity of his present situation.

</pre>
    <p>
      When Roland Graeme was a youth about seventeen years of age, he chanced
      one summer morning to descend to the mew in which Sir Halbert Glendinning
      kept his hawks, in order to superintend the training of an eyas, or young
      hawk, which he himself, at the imminent risk of neck and limbs, had taken
      from the celebrated eyry in the neighborhood, called Gledscraig. As he was
      by no means satisfied with the attention which had been bestowed on his
      favourite bird, he was not slack in testifying his displeasure to the
      falconer's lad, whose duty it was to have attended upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, ho! sir knave,&rdquo; exclaimed Roland, &ldquo;is it thus you feed the eyas
      with unwashed meat, as if you were gorging the foul brancher of a
      worthless hoodie-crow? by the mass, and thou hast neglected its castings
      also for these two days! Think'st thou I ventured my neck to bring the
      bird down from the crag, that thou shouldst spoil him by thy neglect?&rdquo; And
      to add force to his remonstrances, he conferred a cuff or two on the
      negligent attendant of the hawks, who, shouting rather louder than was
      necessary under all the circumstances, brought the master falconer to his
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Woodcock, the falconer of Avenel, was an Englishman by birth, but so
      long in the service of Glendinning, that he had lost much of his notional
      attachment in that which he had formed to his master. He was a favourite
      in his department, jealous and conceited of his skill, as masters of the
      game usually are; for the rest of his character he was a jester and a
      parcel poet, (qualities which by no means abated his natural conceit,) a
      jolly fellow, who, though a sound Protestant, loved a flagon of ale better
      than a long sermon, a stout man of his hands when need required, true to
      his master, and a little presuming on his interest with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Woodcock, such as we have described him, by no means relished the
      freedom used by young Graeme, in chastising his assistant. &ldquo;Hey, hey, my
      Lady's page,&rdquo; said he, stepping between his own boy and Roland, &ldquo;fair and
      softly, an it like your gilt jacket&mdash;hands off is fair play&mdash;if
      my boy has done amiss, I can beat him myself, and then you may keep your
      hands soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will beat him and thee too,&rdquo; answered Roland, without hesitation, &ldquo;an
      you look not better after your business. See how the bird is cast away
      between you. I found the careless lurdane feeding him with unwashed flesh,
      and she an eyas.&rdquo; [Footnote: There is a difference amongst authorities how
      long the nestling hawk should be fed with flesh which has previously been
      washed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;thou art but an eyas thyself, child Roland.&mdash;What
      knowest thou of feeding? I say that the eyas should have her meat
      unwashed, until she becomes a brancher&mdash;'twere the ready way to give
      her the frounce, to wash her meat sooner, and so knows every one who knows
      a gled from a falcon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thine own laziness, thou false English blood, that dost nothing but
      drink and sleep,&rdquo; retorted the page, &ldquo;and leaves that lither lad to do the
      work, which he minds as little as thou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I so idle then,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;that have three cast of hawks
      to look after, at perch and mew, and to fly them in the field to boot?&mdash;and
      is my Lady's page so busy a man that he must take me up short?&mdash;and
      am I of false English blood?&mdash;I marvel what blood thou art&mdash;neither
      Englander nor Scot&mdash;fish nor flesh&mdash;a bastard from the
      Debateable Land, without either kith, kin, or ally!&mdash;Marry, out upon
      thee, foul kite, that would fain be a tercel gentle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply to this sarcasm was a box on the ear, so well applied, that it
      overthrew the falconer into the cistern in which water was kept for the
      benefit of the hawks. Up started Adam Woodcock, his wrath no way appeased
      by the cold immersion, and seizing on a truncheon which stood by, would
      have soon requited the injury he had received, had not Roland laid his
      hand on his poniard, and sworn by all that was sacred, that if he offered
      a stroke towards him, he would sheath the blade in his bowels. The noise
      was now so great, that more than one of the household came in, and amongst
      others the major-domo, a grave personage, already mentioned, whose gold
      chain and white wand intimated his authority. At the appearance of this
      dignitary, the strife was for the present appeased. He embraced, however,
      so favourable an opportunity, to read Roland Graeme a shrewd lecture on
      the impropriety of his deportment to his fellow-menials, and to assure
      him, that, should he communicate this fray to his master, (who, though now
      on one of his frequent expeditions, was speedily expected to return,)
      which but for respect to his Lady he would most certainly do, the
      residence of the culprit in the Castle of Avenel would be but of brief
      duration. &ldquo;But, however,&rdquo; added the prudent master of the household, &ldquo;I
      will report the matter first to my Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very just, very right, Master Wingate,&rdquo; exclaimed several voices
      together; &ldquo;my Lady will consider if daggers, are to be drawn on us for
      every idle word, and whether we are to live in a well-ordered household,
      where there is the fear of God, or amidst drawn dirks and sharp knives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The object of this general resentment darted an angry glance around him,
      and suppressing with difficulty the desire which urged him to reply in
      furious or in contemptuous language, returned his dagger into his
      scabbard, looked disdainfully around upon the assembled menials, turned
      short upon his heel, and pushing aside those who stood betwixt him and the
      door, left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be no tree for my nest,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;if this
      cock-sparrow is to crow over us as he seems to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struck me with his switch yesterday,&rdquo; said one of the grooms, &ldquo;because
      the tail of his worship's gelding was not trimmed altogether so as suited
      his humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I promise you,&rdquo; said the laundress, &ldquo;my young master will stick
      nothing to call an honest woman slut and quean, if there be but a speck of
      soot upon his band-collar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Master Wingate do not his errand to my Lady,&rdquo; was the general result,
      &ldquo;there will be no tarrying in the same house with Roland Graeme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master of the household heard them all for some time, and then,
      motioning for universal silence, he addressed them with all the dignity of
      Malvolio himself.&mdash;&ldquo;My masters,&mdash;not forgetting you, my
      mistresses,&mdash;do not think the worse of me that I proceed with as much
      care as haste in this matter. Our master is a gallant knight, and will
      have his sway at home and abroad, in wood and field, in hall and bower, as
      the saying is. Our Lady, my benison upon her, is also a noble person of
      long descent, and rightful heir of this place and barony, and she also
      loves her will; as for that matter, show me the woman who doth not. Now,
      she hath favoured, doth favour, and will favour, this jack-an-ape,&mdash;for
      what good part about him I know not, save that as one noble lady will love
      a messan dog, and another a screaming popinjay, and a third a Barbary ape,
      so doth it please our noble dame to set her affections upon this stray elf
      of a page, for nought that I can think of, save that she&mdash;was the
      cause of his being saved (the more's the pity) from drowning.&rdquo; And here
      Master Wingate made a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have been his caution for a gray groat against salt water or
      fresh,&rdquo; said Roland's adversary, the falconer; &ldquo;marry, if he crack not a
      rope for stabbing or for snatching, I will be content never to hood hawk
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, Adam Woodcock,&rdquo; said Wingate, waving his hand; &ldquo;I prithee, peace
      man&mdash;Now, my Lady liking this springald, as aforesaid, differs
      therein from my Lord, who loves never a bone in his skin. Now, is it for
      me to stir up strife betwixt them, and put as'twere my finger betwixt the
      bark and the tree, on account of a pragmatical youngster, whom,
      nevertheless, I would willingly see whipped forth of the barony? Have
      patience, and this boil will break without our meddling. I have been in
      service since I wore a beard on my chin, till now that that beard is
      turned gray, and I have seldom known any one better themselves, even by
      taking the lady's part against the lord's; but never one who did not dirk
      himself, if he took the lord's against the lady's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Lilias, &ldquo;we are to be crowed over, every one of us, men and
      women, cock and hen, by this little upstart?&mdash;I will try titles with
      him first, I promise you.&mdash;I fancy, Master Wingate, for as wise as
      you look, you will be pleased to tell what you have seen to-day, if my
      lady commands you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak the truth when my lady commands me,&rdquo; answered the prudential
      major-domo, &ldquo;is in some measure my duty, Mistress Lilias; always providing
      for and excepting those cases in which it cannot be spoken without
      breeding mischief and inconvenience to myself or my fellow-servants; for
      the tongue of a tale-bearer breaketh bones as well as Jeddart-staff.&rdquo;
       [Footnote: A species of battle-axe, so called as being in especial use in
      that ancient burgh, whose armorial bearing still represent an armed
      horseman brandishing such a weapon.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this imp of Satan is none of your friends or fellow-servants,&rdquo; said
      Lilias; &ldquo;and I trust you mean not to stand up for him against the whole
      family besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Credit me, Mrs. Lilias,&rdquo; replied the senior, &ldquo;should I see the time
      fitting, I would, with right good-will give him a lick with the rough side
      of my tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said, Master Wingate,&rdquo; answered Lilias; &ldquo;then trust me his song
      shall soon be laid. If my mistress does not ask me what is the matter
      below stairs before she be ten minutes of time older, she is no born
      woman, and my name is not Lilias Bradbourne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of her plan, Mistress Lilias failed not to present herself
      before her mistress with all the exterior of one who is possessed of an
      important secret,&mdash;that is, she had the corners of her mouth turned
      down, her eyes raised up, her lips pressed as fast together as if they had
      been sewed up, to prevent her babbling, and an air of prim mystical
      importance diffused over her whole person and demeanour, which seemed to
      intimate, &ldquo;I know something which I am resolved not to tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias had rightly read her mistress's temper, who, wise and good as she
      was, was yet a daughter of grandame Eve, and could not witness this
      mysterious bearing on the part of her waiting-woman without longing to
      ascertain the secret cause. For a space, Mrs. Lilias was obdurate to all
      inquiries, sighed, turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven, hoped for the
      best, but had nothing particular to communicate. All this, as was most
      natural and proper, only stimulated the Lady's curiosity; neither was her
      importunity to be parried with,&mdash;&ldquo;Thank God, I am no makebate&mdash;no
      tale-bearer,&mdash;thank God, I never envied any one's favour, or was
      anxious to propale their misdemeanour-only, thank God, there has been no
      bloodshed and murder in the house&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bloodshed and murder!&rdquo; exclaimed the Lady, &ldquo;what does the quean mean?&mdash;if
      you speak not plain out, you shall have something you will scarce be
      thankful for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my Lady,&rdquo; answered Lilias, eager to disburden her mind, or, in,
      Chaucer's phrase, to &ldquo;unbuckle her mail,&rdquo; &ldquo;if you bid me speak out the
      truth, you must not be moved with what might displease you&mdash;Roland
      Graeme has dirked Adam Woodstock&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; said the Lady, turning pale as ashes, &ldquo;is the man slain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; replied Lilias, &ldquo;but slain he would have been, if there had
      not been ready help; but may be, it is your Ladyship's pleasure that this
      young esquire shall poniard the servants, as well as switch and baton
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to, minion,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;you are saucy-tell the master of the
      household to attend me instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilias hastened to seek out Mr. Wingate, and hurry him to his lady's
      presence, speaking as a word in season to him on the way, &ldquo;I have set the
      stone a-trowling, look that you do not let it stand still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward, too prudential a person to commit himself otherwise, answered
      by a sly look and a nod of intelligence, and presently after stood in the
      presence of the Lady of Avenel, with a look of great respect for his lady,
      partly real, partly affected, and an air of great sagacity, which inferred
      no ordinary conceit of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, Wingate,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;and what rule do you keep in the
      castle, that the domestics of Sir Halbert Glendinning draw the dagger on
      each other, as in a cavern of thieves and murderers?&mdash;is the wounded
      man much hurt? and what&mdash;what hath become of the unhappy boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one wounded as yet, madam,&rdquo; replied he of the golden chain;
      &ldquo;it passes my poor skill to say how many may be wounded before Pasche,
      [Footnote: Easter.] if some rule be not taken with this youth&mdash;not
      but the youth is a fair youth,&rdquo; he added, correcting himself, &ldquo;and able at
      his exercise; but somewhat too ready with the ends of his fingers, the
      butt of his riding-switch, and the point of his dagger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whose fault is that,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;but yours, who should have
      taught him better discipline, than to brawl or to draw his dagger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it please your Ladyship so to impose the blame on me,&rdquo; answered the
      steward, &ldquo;it is my part, doubtless, to bear it&mdash;only I submit to your
      consideration, that unless I nailed his weapon to the scabbard, I could no
      more keep it still, than I could fix quicksilver, which defied even the
      skill of Raymond Lullius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me not of Raymond Lullius,&rdquo; said the Lady, losing patience, &ldquo;but
      send me the chaplain hither. You grow all of you too wise for me, during
      your lord's long and repeated absences. I would to God his affairs would
      permit him to remain at home and rule his own household, for it passes my
      wit and skill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, my Lady!&rdquo; said the old domestic, &ldquo;that you should sincerely
      think what you are now pleased to say: your old servants might well hope,
      that after so many years' duty, you would do their service more justice
      than to distrust their gray hairs, because they cannot rule the peevish
      humour of a green head, which the owner carries, it may be, a brace of
      inches higher than becomes him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;Sir Halbert's return must now be expected
      daily, and he will look into these matters himself&mdash;leave me, I say,
      Wingate, without saying more of it. I know you are honest, and I believe
      the boy is petulant; and yet I think it is my favour which hath set all of
      you against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward bowed and retired, after having been silenced in a second
      attempt to explain the motives on which he acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain arrived; but neither from him did the Lady receive much
      comfort. On the contrary, she found him disposed, in plain terms, to lay
      to the door of her indulgence all the disturbances which the fiery temper
      of Roland Graeme had already occasioned, or might hereafter occasion, in
      the family. &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;honoured Lady, that you had deigned to be
      ruled by me in the outset of this matter, sith it is easy to stem evil in
      the fountain, but hard to struggle against it in the stream. You, honoured
      madam, (a word which I do not use according to the vain forms of this
      world, but because I have ever loved and honoured you as an honourable and
      elect lady,)&mdash;you, I say, madam, have been pleased, contrary to my
      poor but earnest counsel, to raise this boy from his station, into one
      approaching to your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean you, reverend sir?&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;I have made this youth a
      page&mdash;is there aught in my doing so that does not become my character
      and quality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dispute not, madam,&rdquo; said the pertinacious preacher, &ldquo;your benevolent
      purpose in taking charge of this youth, or your title to give him this
      idle character of page, if such was your pleasure; though what the
      education of a boy in the train of a female can tend to, save to ingraft
      foppery and effeminacy on conceit and arrogance, it passes my knowledge to
      discover. But I blame you more directly for having taken little care to
      guard him against the perils of his condition, or to tame and humble a
      spirit naturally haughty, overbearing, and impatient. You have brought
      into your bower a lion's cub; delighted with the beauty of his fur, and
      the grace of his gambols, you have bound him with no fetters befitting the
      fierceness of his disposition. You have let him grow up as unawed as if he
      had been still a tenant of the forest, and now you are surprised, and call
      out for assistance, when he begins to ramp, rend, and tear, according to
      his proper nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Warden,&rdquo; said the Lady, considerably offended, &ldquo;you are my husband's
      ancient friend, and I believe your love sincere to him and to his
      household. Yet let me say, that when I asked you for counsel, I expected
      not this asperity of rebuke. If I have done wrong in loving this poor
      orphan lad more than others of his class, I scarce think the error merited
      such severe censure; and if stricter discipline were required to keep his
      fiery temper in order, it ought, I think, to be considered, that I am a
      woman, and that if I have erred in this matter, it becomes a friend's part
      rather to aid than to rebuke me. I would these evils were taken order with
      before my lord's return. He loves not domestic discord or domestic brawls;
      and I would not willingly that he thought such could arise from one whom I
      favoured&mdash;What do you counsel me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismiss this youth from your service, madam,&rdquo; replied the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot bid me do so,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;you cannot, as a Christian and
      a man of humanity, bid me turn away an unprotected creature against whom
      my favour, my injudicious favour if you will, has reared up so many
      enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary you should altogether abandon him, though you dismiss
      him to another service, or to a calling better suiting his station and
      character,&rdquo; said the preacher; &ldquo;elsewhere he maybe an useful and
      profitable member of the commonweal&mdash;here he is but a makebate, and a
      stumbling-block of offence. The youth has snatches of sense and of
      intelligence, though he lacks industry. I will myself give him letters
      commendatory to Olearius Schinderhausen, a learned professor at the famous
      university of Leyden, where they lack an under-janitor&mdash;where,
      besides gratis instruction, if God give him the grace to seek it, he will
      enjoy five merks by the year, and the professor's cast-off suit, which he
      disparts with biennially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do, good Mr. Warden,&rdquo; said the Lady, scarce able to
      suppress a smile; &ldquo;we will think more at large upon this matter. In the
      meanwhile, I trust to your remonstrances with this wild boy and with the
      family, for restraining these violent and unseemly jealousies and bursts
      of passion; and I entreat you to press on him and them their duty in this
      respect towards God, and towards their master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be obeyed, madam,&rdquo; said Warden. &ldquo;On the next Thursday I exhort
      the family, and will, with God's blessing, so wrestle with the demon of
      wrath and violence, which hath entered into my little flock, that I trust
      to hound the wolf out of the fold, as if he were chased away with
      bandogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the part of the conference from which Mr. Warden derived the
      greatest pleasure. The pulpit was at that time the same powerful engine
      for affecting popular feeling which the press has since become, and he had
      been no unsuccessful preacher, as we have already seen. It followed as a
      natural consequence, that he rather over-estimated the powers of his own
      oratory, and, like some of his brethren about the period, was glad of an
      opportunity to handle any matters of importance, whether public or
      private, the discussion of which could be dragged into his discourse. In
      that rude age the delicacy was unknown which prescribed time and place to
      personal exhortations; and as the court-preacher often addressed the King
      individually, and dictated to him the conduct he ought to observe in
      matters of state, so the nobleman himself, or any of his retainers, were,
      in the chapel of the feudal castle, often incensed or appalled, as the
      case might be, by the discussion of their private faults in the evening
      exercise, and by spiritual censures directed against them, specifically,
      personally, and by name. The sermon, by means of which Henry Warden
      purposed to restore concord and good order to the Castle of Avenel, bore
      for text the well-known words, &ldquo;<i>He who striketh with the sword shall
      perish by the sword,</i>&rdquo; and was a singular mixture of good sense and
      powerful oratory with pedantry and bad taste. He enlarged a good deal on
      the word striketh, which he assured his hearers comprehended blows given
      with the point as well as with the edge, and more generally, shooting with
      hand-gun, cross-bow, or long-bow, thrusting with a lance, or doing any
      thing whatever by which death might be occasioned to the adversary. In the
      same manner, he proved satisfactorily, that the word sword comprehended
      all descriptions, whether backsword or basket-hilt, cut-and-thrust or
      rapier, falchion, or scimitar. &ldquo;But if,&rdquo; he continued, with still greater
      animation, &ldquo;the text includeth in its anathema those who strike with any
      of those weapons which man hath devised for the exercise of his open
      hostility, still more doth it comprehend such as from their form and size
      are devised rather for the gratification of privy malice by treachery,
      than for the destruction of an enemy prepared and standing upon his
      defence. Such,&rdquo; he proceeded, looking sternly at the place where the page
      was seated on a cushion at the feet of his mistress, and wearing in his
      crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded hilt,&mdash;&ldquo;such, more
      especially, I hold to be those implements of death, which, in our modern
      and fantastic times, are worn not only by thieves and cut-throats, to whom
      they most properly belong, but even by those who attend upon women, and
      wait in the chambers of honourable ladies. Yes, my friends,&mdash;every
      species of this unhappy weapon, framed for all evil and for no good, is
      comprehended under this deadly denunciation, whether it be a stillet,
      which we have borrowed from the treacherous Italian, or a dirk, which is
      borne by the savage Highlandman, or a whinger, which is carried by our own
      Border thieves and cut-throats, or a dudgeon-dagger, all are alike engines
      invented by the devil himself, for ready implements of deadly wrath,
      sudden to execute, and difficult to be parried. Even the common
      sword-and-buckler brawler despises the use of such a treacherous and
      malignant instrument, which is therefore fit to be used, not by men or
      soldiers, but by those who, trained under female discipline, become
      themselves effeminate hermaphrodites, having female spite and female
      cowardice added to the infirmities and evil passions of their masculine
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect which this oration produced upon the assembled congregation of
      Avenel cannot very easily be described. The lady seemed at once
      embarrassed and offended; the menials could hardly contain, under an
      affectation of deep attention, the joy with which they heard the chaplain
      launch his thunders at the head of the unpopular favourite, and the weapon
      which they considered as a badge of affectation and finery. Mrs. Lilias
      crested and drew up her head with all the deep-felt pride of gratified
      resentment; while the steward, observing a strict neutrality of aspect,
      fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon on the opposite side of the wall,
      which he seemed to examine with the utmost accuracy, more willing,
      perhaps, to incur the censure of being inattentive to the sermon, than
      that of seeming to listen with marked approbation to what appeared so
      distasteful to his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate subject of the harangue, whom nature had endowed with
      passions which had hitherto found no effectual restraint, could not
      disguise the resentment which he felt at being thus directly held up to
      the scorn, as well as the censure, of the assembled inhabitants of the
      little world in which he lived. His brow grew red, his lip grew pale, he
      set his teeth, he clenched his hand, and then with mechanical readiness
      grasped the weapon of which the clergyman had given so hideous a
      character; and at length, as the preacher heightened the colouring of his
      invective, he felt his rage become so ungovernable, that, fearful of being
      hurried into some deed of desperate violence, he rose up, traversed the
      chapel with hasty steps, and left the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher was surprised into a sudden pause, while the fiery youth shot
      across him like a flash of lightning, regarding him as he passed, as if he
      had wished to dart from his eyes the same power of blighting and of
      consuming. But no sooner had he crossed the chapel, and shut with violence
      behind him the door of the vaulted entrance by which it communicated with
      the castle, than the impropriety of his conduct supplied Warden with one
      of those happier subjects for eloquence, of which he knew how to take
      advantage for making a suitable impression on his hearers. He paused for
      an instant, and then pronounced, in a slow and solemn voice, the deep
      anathema: &ldquo;He hath gone out from us because he was not of us&mdash;the
      sick man hath been offended at the wholesome bitter of the medicine&mdash;the
      wounded patient hath flinched from the friendly knife of the surgeon&mdash;the
      sheep hath fled from the sheepfold and delivered himself to the wolf,
      because he could not assume the quiet and humble conduct demanded of us by
      the great Shepherd. Ah! my brethren, beware of wrath&mdash;beware of pride&mdash;beware
      of the deadly and destroying sin which so often shows itself to our frail
      eyes in the garments of light! What is our earthly honour? Pride, and
      pride only&mdash;What our earthly gifts and graces? Pride and vanity.
      Voyagers speak of Indian men who deck themselves with shells, and anoint
      themselves with pigments, and boast of their attire as we do of our
      miserable carnal advantages&mdash;Pride could draw down the morning-star
      from Heaven even to the verge of the pit&mdash;Pride and self-opinion
      kindled the flaming sword which waves us off from Paradise&mdash;Pride
      made Adam mortal, and a weary wanderer on the face of the earth, which he
      had else been at this day the immortal lord of&mdash;Pride brought amongst
      us sin, and doubles every sin it has brought. It is the outpost which the
      devil and the flesh most stubbornly maintain against the assaults of
      grace; and until it be subdued, and its barriers levelled with the very
      earth, there is more hope of a fool than of the sinner. Rend, then, from
      your bosoms this accursed shoot of the fatal apple; tear it up by the
      roots, though it be twisted with the chords of your life. Profit by the
      example of the miserable sinner that has passed from us, and embrace the
      means of grace while it is called to-day 'ere your conscience is seared as
      with a fire-brand, and your ears deafened like those of the adder, and
      your heart hardened like the nether mill-stone. Up, then, and be doing&mdash;wrestle
      and overcome; resist, and the enemy shall flee from you&mdash;Watch and
      pray, lest ye fall into temptation, and let the stumbling of others be
      your warning and your example. Above all, rely not on yourselves, for such
      self-confidence is even the worst symptom of the disorder itself. The
      Pharisee, perhaps, deemed himself humble while he stooped in the Temple,
      and thanked God that he was not as other men, and even as the publican.
      But while his knees touched the marble pavement, his head was as high as
      the topmost pinnacle of the Temple. Do not, therefore, deceive yourselves,
      and offer false coin, where the purest you can present is but as dross&mdash;think
      not that such&mdash;will pass the assay of Omnipotent Wisdom. Yet shrink
      not from the task, because, as is my bounden duty, I do not disguise from
      you its difficulties. Self-searching can do much&mdash;Meditation can do
      much&mdash;Grace can do all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he concluded with a touching and animating exhortation to his hearers
      to seek divine grace, which is perfected in human wakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience did not listen to this address without being considerably
      affected; though it might be doubted whether the feelings of triumph,
      excited by the disgraceful retreat of the favourite page, did not greatly
      qualify in the minds of many the exhortations of the preacher to charity
      and to humility. And, in fact, the expression of their countenances much
      resembled the satisfied triumphant air of a set of children, who, having
      just seen a companion punished for a fault in which they had no share, con
      their task with double glee, both because they themselves are out of the
      scrape, and because the culprit is in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With very different feelings did the Lady of Avenel seek her own
      apartment. She felt angry at Warden having made a domestic matter, in
      which she took a personal interest, the subject of such public discussion.
      But this she knew the good man claimed as a branch of his Christian
      liberty as a preacher, and also that it was vindicated by the universal
      custom of his brethren. But the self-willed conduct of her protegé
      afforded her yet deeper concern. That he had broken through in so
      remarkable a degree, not only the respect due to her presence, but that
      which was paid to religious admonition in those days with such peculiar
      reverence, argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies had represented
      him to possess. And yet so far as he had been under her own eye, she had
      seen no more of that fiery spirit than appeared to her to become his years
      and his vivacity. This opinion might be founded in some degree on
      partiality; in some degree, too, it might be owing to the kindness and
      indulgence which she had always extended to him; but still she thought it
      impossible that she could be totally mistaken in the estimate she had
      formed of his character. The extreme of violence is scarce consistent with
      a course of continued hypocrisy, (although Lilias charitably hinted, that
      in some instances they were happily united,) and there fore she could not
      exactly trust the report of others against her own experience and
      observation. The thoughts of this orphan boy clung to her heartstrings
      with a fondness for which she herself was unable to account. He seemed to
      have been sent to her by Heaven, to fill up those intervals of languor and
      vacuity which deprived her of much enjoyment. Perhaps he was not less dear
      to her, because she well saw that he was a favourite with no one else, and
      because she felt, that to give him up was to afford the judgment of her
      husband and others a triumph over her own; a circumstance not quite
      indifferent to the best of spouses of either sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the Lady of Avenel formed the internal resolution, that she
      would not desert her page while her page could be rationally protected;
      and, with a view of ascertaining how far this might be done, she caused
      him to be summoned to her presence.

  &mdash;In the wild storm,

  Heaves to the billows wares he once deem'd precious;

                                  OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was some time ere Roland Graeme appeared. The messenger (his old friend
      Lilias) had at first attempted to open the door of his little apartment
      with the charitable purpose, doubtless, of enjoying the confusion, and
      marking the demeanour of the culprit. But an oblong bit of iron, ycleped a
      bolt, was passed across the door on the inside, and prevented her benign
      intentions. Lilias knocked and called at intervals. &ldquo;Roland&mdash;Roland
      Graeme&mdash;<i>Master</i> Roland Graeme&rdquo; (an emphasis on the word
      Master,) &ldquo;will you be pleased to undo the door?&mdash;What ails you?&mdash;are
      you at your prayers in private, to complete the devotion which you left
      unfinished in public?&mdash;Surely we must have a screened seat for you in
      the chapel, that your gentility may be free from the eyes of common
      folks!&rdquo; Still no whisper was heard in reply. &ldquo;Well, master Roland,&rdquo; said
      the waiting-maid, &ldquo;I must tell my mistress, that if she would have an
      answer, she must either come herself, or send those on errand to you who
      can beat the door down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says your Lady?&rdquo; answered the page from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, open the door, and you shall hear,&rdquo; answered the waiting-maid. &ldquo;I
      trow it becomes my Lady's message to be listened to face to face; and I
      will not for your idle pleasure, whistle it through a key-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistress's name,&rdquo; said the page, opening the door, &ldquo;is too fair a
      cover for your impertinence&mdash;What says my Lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will be pleased to come to her directly, in the
      withdrawing-room,&rdquo; answered Lilias. &ldquo;I presume she has some directions for
      you concerning the forms to be observed in leaving chapel in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to my Lady, that I will directly wait on her,&rdquo; answered the page; and
      returning into his apartment, he once more locked the door in the face of
      the waiting-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rare courtesy!&rdquo; muttered Lilias; and, returning to her mistress,
      acquainted her that Roland Graeme would wait on her when it suited his
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is that his addition, or your own phrase, Lilias?&rdquo; said the Lady,
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; replied the attendant, not directly answering the question,
      &ldquo;he looked as if he could have said much more impertinent things than
      that, if I had been willing to hear them.&mdash;But here he comes to
      answer for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme entered the apartment with a loftier mien, and somewhat a
      higher colour than his wont; there was embarrassment in his manner, but it
      was neither that of fear nor of penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;what trow you I am to think of your conduct
      this day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it has offended you, madam, I am deeply grieved,&rdquo; replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have offended me alone,&rdquo; replied the Lady, &ldquo;were but little&mdash;You
      have been guilty of conduct which will highly offend your master&mdash;of
      violence to your fellow-servants, and of disrespect to God himself, in the
      person of his ambassador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me again to reply,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;that if I have offended my
      only mistress, friend, and benefactress, it includes the sum of my guilt,
      and deserves the sum of my penitence&mdash;Sir Halbert Glendinning calls
      me not servant, nor do I call him master&mdash;he is not entitled to blame
      me for chastising an insolent groom&mdash;nor do I fear the wrath of
      Heaven for treating with scorn the unauthorized interference of a meddling
      preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Avenel had before this seen symptoms in her favourite of
      boyish petulance, and of impatience of censure or reproof. But his present
      demeanour was of a graver and more determined character, and she was for a
      moment at a loss how she should treat the youth, who seemed to have at
      once assumed the character not only of a man, but of a bold and determined
      one. She paused an instant, and then assuming the dignity which was
      natural to her, she said, &ldquo;Is it to me, Roland, that you hold this
      language? Is it for the purpose of making me repent the favour I have
      shown you, that you declare yourself independent both of an earthly and a
      Heavenly master? Have you forgotten what you were, and to what the loss of
      my protection would speedily again reduce you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I have forgot nothing, I remember but too much. I
      know, that but for you, I should have perished in yon blue waves,&rdquo;
       pointing, as he spoke, to the lake, which was seen through the window,
      agitated by the western wind. &ldquo;Your goodness has gone farther, madam&mdash;you
      have protected me against the malice of others, and against my own folly.
      You are free, if you are willing, to abandon the orphan you have reared.
      You have left nothing undone by him, and he complains of nothing. And yet,
      Lady, do not think I have been ungrateful&mdash;I have endured something
      on my part, which I would have borne for the sake of no one but my
      benefactress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake!&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;and what is it that I can have subjected
      you to endure, which can be remembered with other feelings than those of
      thanks and gratitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too just, madam, to require me to be thankful for the cold
      neglect with which your husband has uniformly treated me&mdash;neglect not
      unmingled with fixed aversion. You are too just, madam, to require me to
      be grateful for the constant and unceasing marks of scorn and malevolence
      with which I have been treated by others, or for such a homily as that
      with which your reverend chaplain has, at my expense, this very day
      regaled the assembled household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard mortal ears the like of this!&rdquo; said the waiting-maid, with her
      hands expanded and her eyes turned up to heaven; &ldquo;he speaks as if he were
      son of an earl, or of a belted knight the least penny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page glanced on her a look of supreme contempt, but vouchsafed no
      other answer. His mistress, who began to feel herself seriously offended,
      and yet sorry for the youth's folly, took up the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Roland, you forget yourself so strangely,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you
      will tempt me to take serious measures to lower you in your own opinion by
      reducing you to your proper station in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; added Lilias, &ldquo;would be best done by turning him out the same
      beggar's brat that your ladyship took him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilias speaks too rudely,&rdquo; continued the Lady, &ldquo;but she has spoken the
      truth, young man; nor do I think I ought to spare that pride which hath so
      completely turned your head. You have been tricked up with fine garments,
      and treated like the son of a gentleman, until you have forgot the
      fountain of your churlish blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craving your pardon, most honourable madam, Lilias hath <i>not</i> spoken
      truth, nor does your ladyship know aught of my descent, which should
      entitle you to treat it with such decided scorn. I am no beggar's brat&mdash;my
      grandmother begged from no one, here nor elsewhere&mdash;she would have
      perished sooner on the bare moor. We were harried out and driven from our
      home&mdash;a chance which has happed elsewhere, and to others. Avenel
      Castle, with its lake and its towers, was not at all times able to protect
      its inhabitants from want and desolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear but his assurance!&rdquo; said Lilias, &ldquo;he upbraids my Lady with the
      distresses of her family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had indeed been a theme more gratefully spared,&rdquo; said the Lady,
      affected nevertheless with the allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was necessary, madam, for my vindication,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;or I had
      not even hinted at a word that might give you pain. But believe, honoured
      Lady, I am of no churl's blood. My proper descent I know not; but my only
      relation has said, and my heart has echoed it back and attested the truth,
      that I am sprung of gentle blood, and deserve gentle usage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And upon an assurance so vague as this,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;do you propose
      to expect all the regard, all the privileges, befitting high rank and
      distinguished birth, and become a contender for concessions which are only
      due to the noble? Go to, sir, know yourself, or the master of the
      household shall make you know you are liable to the scourge as a malapert
      boy. You have tasted too little the discipline fit for your age and
      station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master of the household shall taste of my dagger, ere I taste of his
      discipline,&rdquo; said the page, giving way to his restrained passion. &ldquo;Lady, I
      have been too long the vassal of a pantoufle, and the slave of a silver
      whistle. You must henceforth find some other to answer your call; and let
      him be of birth and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn of your menials,
      and to call a church vassal his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have deserved this insult,&rdquo; said the Lady, colouring deeply, &ldquo;for so
      long enduring and fostering your petulance. Begone, sir. Leave this castle
      to-night&mdash;I will send you the means of subsistence till you find some
      honest mode of support, though I fear your imaginary grandeur will be
      above all others, save those of rapine and violence. Begone, sir, and see
      my face no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page threw himself at her feet in an agony of sorrow. &ldquo;My dear and
      honoured mistress,&rdquo; he said, but was unable to bring out another syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arise, sir,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;and let go my mantle&mdash;hypocrisy is a
      poor cloak for ingratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am incapable of either, madam,&rdquo; said the page, springing up with the
      hasty start of passion which belonged to his rapid and impetuous temper.
      &ldquo;Think not I meant to implore permission to reside here; it has been long
      my determination to leave Avenel, and I will never forgive myself for
      having permitted you to say the word begone, ere I said, 'I leave you.' I
      did but kneel to ask your forgiveness for an ill-considered word used in
      the height of displeasure, but which ill became my mouth, as addressed to
      you. Other grace I asked not&mdash;you have done much for me&mdash;but I
      repeat, that you better know what you yourself have done, than what I have
      suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roland,&rdquo; said the Lady, somewhat appeased, and relenting towards her
      favourite, &ldquo;you had me to appeal to when you were aggrieved. You were
      neither called upon to suffer wrong, nor entitled to resent it, when you
      were under my protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;if I sustained wrong from those you loved and
      favoured, was I to disturb your peace with idle tale-bearings and eternal
      complaints? No, madam; I have borne my own burden in silence, and without
      disturbing you with murmurs; and the respect with which you accuse me of
      wanting, furnishes the only reason why I have neither appealed to you, nor
      taken vengeance at my own hand in a manner far more effectual. It is well,
      however, that we part. I was not born to be a stipendiary, favoured by his
      mistress, until ruined by the calumnies of others. May Heaven multiply its
      choicest blessings on your honoured head; and, for your sake, upon all
      that are dear to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to leave the apartment, when the Lady called upon him to
      return. He stood still, while she thus addressed him: &ldquo;It was not my
      intention, nor would it be just, even in the height of my displeasure, to
      dismiss you without the means of support; take this purse of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Lady,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;and let me go hence with the
      consciousness that I have not been degraded to the point of accepting
      alms. If my poor services can be placed against the expense of my apparel
      and my maintenance, I only remain debtor to you for my life, and that
      alone is a debt which I can never repay; put up then that purse, and only
      say, instead, that you do not part from me in anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not in anger,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;in sorrow rather for your wilfulness;
      but take the gold, you cannot but need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God evermore bless you for the kind tone and the kind word! but the
      gold I cannot take. I am able of body, and do not lack friends so wholly
      as you may think; for the time may come that I may yet show myself more
      thankful than by mere words.&rdquo; He threw himself on his knees, kissed the
      hand which she did not withdraw, and then, hastily left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias, for a moment or two, kept her eye fixed on her mistress, who
      looked so unusually pale, that she seemed about to faint; but the Lady
      instantly recovered herself, and declining the assistance which her
      attendant offered her, walked to her own apartment.

      Upon the morrow succeeding the scene we have described, the disgraced

      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; answered the steward, gravely; &ldquo;I wish the poor deserted lad no
      ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is gone like a wild-duck, as he came,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Lilias; &ldquo;no
      lowering of drawbridges, or pacing along causeways, for him. My master has
      pushed off in the boat which they call the little Herod, (more shame to
      them for giving the name of a Christian to wood and iron,) and has rowed
      himself by himself to the farther side of the loch, and off and away with
      himself, and left all his finery strewed about his room. I wonder who is
      to clean his trumpery out after him&mdash;though the things are worth
      lifting, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; answered the master of the household, &ldquo;in
      the which case, I am free to think, they will not long cumber the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me, Master Wingate,&rdquo; continued the damsel, &ldquo;do not the very
      cockles of your heart rejoice at the house being rid of this upstart
      whelp, that flung us all into shadow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; replied Wingate, &ldquo;as to rejoicing&mdash;those who
      have lived as long in great families as has been my lot, will be in no
      hurry to rejoice at any thing. And for Roland Graeme, though he may be a
      good riddance in the main, yet what says the very sooth proverb, 'Seldom
      comes a better.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldom comes a better, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Lilias. &ldquo;I say, never can
      come a worse, or one half so bad. He might have been the ruin of our poor
      dear mistress,&rdquo; (here she used her kerchief,) &ldquo;body and soul, and estate
      too; for she spent more coin on his apparel than on any four servants
      about the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; said the sage steward, &ldquo;I do opine that our mistress
      requireth not this pity at your hands, being in all respects competent to
      take care of her own body, soul, and estate into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not mayhap have said so,&rdquo; answered the waiting-woman, &ldquo;had you
      seen how like Lot's wife she looked when young master took his leave. My
      mistress is a good lady, and a virtuous, and a well-doing lady, and a
      well-spoken of&mdash;but I would not Sir Halbert had seen her last evening
      for two and a plack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, foy! foy! foy!&rdquo; reiterated the steward; &ldquo;servants should hear and
      see, and say nothing. Besides that, my lady is utterly devoted to Sir
      Halbert, as well she may, being, as he is, the most renowned knight in
      these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the abigail, &ldquo;I mean no more harm; but they that seek
      least renown abroad, are most apt to find quiet at home, that's all; and
      my Lady's lonesome situation is to be considered, that made her fain to
      take up with the first beggar's brat that a dog brought her out of the
      loch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, therefore,&rdquo; said the steward, &ldquo;I say, rejoice not too much, or too
      hastily, Mistress Lilias; for if your Lady wished a favourite to pass away
      the time, depend upon it, the time will not pass lighter now that he is
      gone. So she will have another favourite to choose for herself; and be
      assured, if she wishes such a toy, she will not lack one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where should she choose one, but among her own tried and faithful
      servants,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lilias, &ldquo;who have broken her bread, and drunk her
      drink, for so many years? I have known many a lady as high as she is, that
      never thought either of a friend or favourite beyond their own
      waiting-woman&mdash;always having a proper respect, at the same time, for
      their old and faithful master of the household, Master Wingate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; replied the steward, &ldquo;I do partly see the mark
      at which you shoot, but I doubt your bolt will fall short. Matters being
      with our Lady as it likes you to suppose, it will neither be your crimped
      pinners, Mrs. Lilias, (speaking of them with due respect,) nor my silver
      hair, or golden chain, that will fill up the void which Roland Graeme must
      needs leave in our Lady's leisure. There will be a learned young divine
      with some new doctrine&mdash;a learned leech with some new drug&mdash;a
      bold cavalier, who will not be refused the favour of wearing her colours
      at a running at the ring&mdash;a cunning harper that could harp the heart
      out of woman's breast, as they say Signer David Rizzio did to our poor
      Queen;&mdash;these are the sort of folk who supply the loss of a
      well-favoured favourite, and not an old steward, or a middle-aged
      waiting-woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Lilias, &ldquo;you have experience, Master Wingate, and truly I
      would my master would leave off his picking hither and thither, and look
      better after the affairs of his household. There will be a papestrie among
      us next, for what should I see among master's clothes but a string of gold
      beads! I promise you, <i>aves</i> and <i>credos</i> both!&mdash;I seized
      on them like a falcon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it not, I doubt it not,&rdquo; said the steward, sagaciously nodding
      his head; &ldquo;I have often noticed that the boy had strange observances which
      savoured of popery, and that he was very jealous to conceal them. But you
      will find the Catholic under the Presbyterian cloak as often as the knave
      under the Friar's hood&mdash;what then? we are all mortal&mdash;Right
      proper beads they are,&rdquo; he added, looking attentively at them, &ldquo;and may
      weigh four ounces of fine gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will have them melted down presently,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;before they be
      the misguiding of some poor blinded soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very cautious, indeed, Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; said the steward, nodding his
      head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have them made,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lilias, &ldquo;into a pair of shoe-buckles; I
      would not wear the Pope's trinkets, or whatever has once borne the shape
      of them, one inch above my instep, were they diamonds instead of gold.&mdash;But
      this is what has come of Father Ambrose coming about the castle, as demure
      as a cat that is about to steal cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Ambrose is our master's brother,&rdquo; said the steward gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Master Wingate,&rdquo; answered the Dame; &ldquo;but is that a good reason
      why he should pervert the king's liege subjects to papistrie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid, Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; answered the sententious major-domo;
      &ldquo;but yet there are worse folk than the Papists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where they are to be found,&rdquo; said the waiting-woman, with some
      asperity; &ldquo;but I believe, Master Wingate, if one were to speak to you
      about the devil himself, you would say there were worse people than
      Satan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly I might say so,&rdquo; replied the steward, &ldquo;supposing that I saw
      Satan standing at my elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiting-woman started, and having exclaimed, &ldquo;God bless us!&rdquo; added, &ldquo;I
      wonder, Master Wingate, you can take pleasure in frightening one thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Mistress Lilias, I had no such purpose,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but look
      you here&mdash;the Papists are but put down for the present, but who knows
      how long this word <i>present</i> will last? There are two great Popish
      earls in the north of England, that abominate the very word reformation; I
      mean the Northumberland and Westmoreland Earls, men of power enough to
      shake any throne in Christendom. Then, though our Scottish king be, God
      bless him, a true Protestant, yet he is but a boy; and here is his mother
      that was our queen&mdash;I trust there is no harm to say, God bless her
      too&mdash;and she is a Catholic; and many begin to think she has had but
      hard measure, such as the Hamiltons in the west, and some of our Border
      clans here, and the Gordons in the north, who are all wishing to see a new
      world; and if such a new world should chance to come up, it is like that
      the Queen will take back her own crown, and that the mass and the cross
      will come up, and then down go pulpits, Geneva-gowns, and black silk
      skull-caps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you, Master Jasper Wingate, who have heard the word, and
      listened unto pure and precious Mr. Henry Warden, have you, I say, the
      patience to speak, or but to think, of popery coming down on us like a
      storm, or of the woman Mary again making the royal seat of Scotland a
      throne of abomination? No marvel that you are so civil to the cowled monk,
      Father Ambrose, when he comes hither with his downcast eyes that he never
      raises to my Lady's face, and with his low sweet-toned voice, and his
      benedicites, and his benisons; and who so ready to take them kindly as
      Master Wingate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress Lilias,&rdquo; replied the butler, with an air which was intended to
      close the debate, &ldquo;there are reasons for all things. If I received Father
      Ambrose debonairly, and suffered him to steal a word now and then with
      this same Roland Graeme, it was not that I cared a brass bodle for his
      benison or malison either, but only because I respected my master's blood.
      And who can answer, if Mary come in again, whether he may not be as stout
      a tree to lean to as ever his brother hath proved to us? For down goes the
      Earl of Murray when the Queen comes by her own again; and good is his luck
      if he can keep the head on his own shoulders. And down goes our Knight,
      with the Earl, his patron; and who so like to mount into his empty saddle
      as this same Father Ambrose? The Pope of Rome can so soon dispense with
      his vows, and then we should have Sir Edward the soldier, instead of
      Ambrose the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anger and astonishment kept Mrs. Lilias silent,&mdash;while her old
      friend, in his self-complacent manner, was making known to her his
      political speculations. At length her resentment found utterance in words
      of great ire and scorn. &ldquo;What, Master Wingate! have you eaten my
      mistress's bread, to say nothing of my master's, so many years, that you
      could live to think of her being dispossessed of her own Castle of Avenel,
      by a wretched monk, who is not a drop's blood to her in the way of
      relation? I, that am but a woman, would try first whether my rock or his
      cowl was the better metal. Shame on you, Master Wingate! I If I had not
      held you as so old an acquaintance, this should have gone to my Lady's
      ears though I had been called pickthank and tale-pyet for my pains, as
      when I told of Roland Graeme shooting the wild swan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Wingate was somewhat dismayed at perceiving, that the details which
      he had given of his far-sighted political views had produced on his hearer
      rather suspicion of his fidelity, than admiration of his wisdom, and
      endeavoured, as hastily as possible, to apologize and to explain, although
      internally extremely offended at the unreasonable view, as he deemed it,
      which it had pleased Mistress Lilias Bradbourne to take of his
      expressions; and mentally convinced that her disapprobation of his
      sentiments arose solely out of the consideration, that though Father
      Ambrose, supposing him to become the master of the castle, would certainly
      require the services of a steward, yet those of a waiting-woman would, in
      the supposed circumstances, be altogether superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his explanation had been received as explanations usually are, the
      two friends separated; Lilias to attend the silver whistle which called
      her to her mistress's chamber, and the sapient major-domo to the duties of
      his own department. They parted with less than their usual degree of
      reverence and regard; for the steward felt that his worldly wisdom was
      rebuked by the more disinterested attachment of the waiting-woman, and
      Mistress Lilias Bradbourne was compelled to consider her old friend as
      something little better than a time-server.

  When I hae a saxpence under my thumb,

  But when I am puir they bid me gae by&mdash;
  Oh, poverty parts good company!
                         OLD SONG.
</pre>
    <p>
      While the departure of the page afforded subject for the conversation
      which we have detailed in our last chapter, the late favourite was far
      advanced on his solitary journey, without well knowing what was its
      object, or what was likely to be its end. He had rowed the skiff in which
      he left the castle, to the side of the lake most distant from the village,
      with the desire of escaping from the notice of the inhabitants. His pride
      whispered, that he would be in his discarded state, only the subject of
      their wonder and compassion; and his generosity told him, that any mark of
      sympathy which his situation should excite, might be unfavourably reported
      at the castle. A trifling incident convinced him he had little to fear for
      his friends on the latter score. He was met by a young man some years
      older than himself, who had on former occasions been but too happy to be
      permitted to share in his sports in the subordinate character of his
      assistant. Ralph Fisher approached to greet him, with all the alacrity of
      an humble friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Master Roland, abroad on this side, and without either hawk or
      hound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hawk or hound,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;I will never perhaps hollo to again. I have
      been dismissed&mdash;that is, I have left the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was surprised. &ldquo;What! you are to pass into the Knight's service, and
      take the black jack and the lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I am not&mdash;I am now leaving the
      service of Avenel for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whither are you going, then?&rdquo; said the young peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that is a question which it craves time to answer&mdash;I have that
      matter to determine yet,&rdquo; replied the disgraced favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;I warrant you it is the same to you which way you
      go&mdash;my Lady would not dismiss you till she had put some lining into
      the pouches of your doublet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sordid slave!&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;dost thou think I would have accepted
      a boon from one who was giving me over a prey to detraction and to ruin,
      at the instigation of a canting priest and a meddling serving-woman? The
      bread that I had bought with such an alms would have choked me at the
      first mouthful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked at his quondam friend with an air of wonder not unmixed with
      contempt. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;no occasion for passion&mdash;each
      man knows his own stomach best&mdash;but, were I on a black moor at this
      time of day, not knowing whither I was going, I should be glad to have a
      broad piece or two in my pouch, come by them as I could.&mdash;But perhaps
      you will go with me to my father's&mdash;that is, for a night, for
      to-morrow we expect my uncle Menelaus and all his folk; but, as I said,
      for one night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cold-blooded limitation of the offered shelter to one night only, and
      that tendered most unwillingly, offended the pride of the discarded
      favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather sleep on the fresh heather, as I have done many a night on
      less occasion,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;than in the smoky garret of your
      father, that smells of peat smoke and usquebaugh like a Highlander's
      plaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may choose, my master, if you are so nice,&rdquo; replied Ralph Fisher;
      &ldquo;you may be glad to smell a peat-fire, and usquebaugh too, if you journey
      long in the fashion you propose. You might have said God-a-mercy for your
      proffer, though&mdash;it is not every one that will put themselves in the
      way of ill-will by harbouring a discarded serving-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I would pray you to remember that I have
      switched you before now, and this is the same riding-wand which you have
      tasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph, who was a thickset clownish figure, arrived at his full strength,
      and conscious of the most complete personal superiority, laughed
      contemptuously at the threats of the slight-made stripling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be the same wand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not the same hand; and that is as
      good rhyme as if it were in a ballad. Look you, my Lady's page that was,
      when your switch was up, it was no fear of you, but of your betters, that
      kept mine down&mdash;and I wot not what hinders me from clearing old
      scores with this hazel rung, and showing you it was your Lady's
      livery-coat which I spared, and not your flesh and blood, Master Roland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his rage, Roland Graeme was just wise enough to see, that
      by continuing this altercation, he would subject himself to very rude
      treatment from the boor, who was so much older and stronger than himself;
      and while his antagonist, with a sort of jeering laugh of defiance, seemed
      to provoke the contest, he felt the full bitterness of his own degraded
      condition, and burst into a passion of tears, which he in vain endeavoured
      to conceal with both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the rough churl was moved with the distress of his quondam companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Master Roland,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did but as 'twere jest with thee&mdash;I
      would not harm thee, man, were it but for old acquaintance sake. But ever
      look to a man's inches ere you talk of switching&mdash;why, thine arm,
      man, is but like a spindle compared to mine.&mdash;But hark, I hear old
      Adam Woodcock hollowing to his hawk&mdash;Come along, man, we will have a
      merry afternoon, and go jollily to my father's in spite of the peat-smoke
      and usquebaugh to boot. Maybe we may put you into some honest way of
      winning your bread, though it's hard to come by in these broken times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate page made no answer, nor did he withdraw his hands from
      his face, and Fisher continued in what he imagined a suitable tone of
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, when you were my Lady's minion, men held you proud, and some
      thought you a Papist, and I wot not what; and so, now that you have no one
      to bear you out, you must be companionable and hearty, and wait on the
      minister's examinations, and put these things out of folk's head; and if
      he says you are in fault, you must jouk your head to the stream; and if a
      gentleman, or a gentleman's gentleman, give you a rough word, or a light
      blow, you must only say, thank you for dusting my doublet, or the like, as
      I have done by you.&mdash;But hark to Woodcock's whistle again. Come, and
      I will teach you all the trick on't as we go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, endeavouring to assume an air of
      indifference and of superiority; &ldquo;but I have another path before me, and
      were it otherwise, I could not tread in yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Master Roland,&rdquo; replied the clown; &ldquo;and every man knows his
      own matters best, and so I will not keep you from the path, as you say.
      Give us a grip of your hand, man, for auld lang syne.&mdash;What! not clap
      palms ere we part?&mdash;well, so be it&mdash;a wilful man will have his
      way, and so farewell, and the blessing of the morning to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morrow&mdash;good-morrow,&rdquo; said Roland, hastily; and the clown
      walked lightly off, whistling as he went, and glad, apparently, to be rid
      of an acquaintance, whose claims might be troublesome, and who had no
      longer the means to be serviceable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme compelled himself to walk on while they were within sight of
      each other that his former intimate might not augur any vacillation of
      purpose, or uncertainty of object, from his remaining on the same spot;
      but the effort was a painful one. He seemed stunned, as it were, and
      giddy; the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound, and quaking under
      his feet like the surface of a bog; and he had once or twice nearly
      fallen, though the path he trode was of firm greensward. He kept
      resolutely moving forward, in spite of the internal agitation to which
      these symptoms belonged, until the distant form of his acquaintance
      disappeared behind the slope of a hill, when his heart failed at once;
      and, sitting down on the turf, remote from human ken, he gave way to the
      natural expressions of wounded pride, grief, and fear, and wept with
      unrestrained profusion and unqualified bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first violent paroxysm of his feelings had subsided, the deserted
      and friendless youth felt that mental relief which usually follows such
      discharges of sorrow. The tears continued to chase each other down his
      cheeks, but they were no longer accompanied by the same sense of
      desolation; an afflicting yet milder sentiment was awakened in his mind,
      by the recollection of his benefactress, of the unwearied kindness which
      had attached her to him, in spite of many acts of provoking petulance, now
      recollected as offences of a deep dye, which had protected him against the
      machinations of others, as well as against the consequences of his own
      folly, and would have continued to do so, had not the excess of his
      presumption compelled her to withdraw her protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever indignity I have borne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has been the just reward of
      my own ingratitude. And have I done well to accept the hospitality, the
      more than maternal kindness, of my protectress, yet to detain from her the
      knowledge of my religion?&mdash;but she shall know that a Catholic has as
      much gratitude as a Puritan&mdash;that I have been thoughtless, but not
      wicked&mdash;that in my wildest moments I have loved, respected, and
      honoured her&mdash;and that the orphan boy might indeed be heedless, but
      was never ungrateful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, as these thoughts passed through his mind, and began hastily to
      retread his footsteps towards the castle. But he checked the first
      eagerness of his repentant haste, when he reflected on the scorn and
      contempt with which the family were likely to see the return of the
      fugitive, humbled, as they must necessarily suppose him, into a
      supplicant, who requested pardon for his fault, and permission to return
      to his service. He slackened his pace, but he stood not still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; he resolutely determined; &ldquo;let them wink, point, nod, sneer,
      speak of the conceit which is humbled, of the pride which has had a fall&mdash;I
      care not; it is a penance due to my folly, and I will endure it with
      patience. But if she also, my benefactress, if she also should think me
      sordid and weak-spirited enough to beg, not for her pardon alone, but for
      a renewal of the advantages which I derived from her favour&mdash;<i>her</i>
      suspicion of my meanness I cannot&mdash;I will not brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, and his pride rallying with constitutional obstinacy
      against his more just feeling, urged that he would incur the scorn of the
      Lady of Avenel, rather than obtain her favour, by following the course
      which the first ardour of his repentant feelings had dictated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had but some plausible pretext,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;some ostensible reason
      for my return, some excuse to allege which might show I came not as a
      degraded supplicant, or a discarded menial, I might go thither&mdash;but
      as I am, I cannot&mdash;my heart would leap from its place and burst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As these thoughts swept through his mind, something passed in the air so
      near him as to dazzle his eyes, and almost to brush the plume in his cap.
      He looked up&mdash;it was the favourite falcon of Sir Halbert, which,
      flying around his head, seemed to claim his attention, as that of a
      well-known friend. Roland extended his arm, and gave the accustomed whoop,
      and the falcon instantly settled on his wrist, and began to prune itself,
      glancing at the youth from time to time an acute and brilliant beam of its
      hazel eye, which seemed to ask why he caressed it not with his usual
      fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Diamond!&rdquo; he said, as if the bird understood him, &ldquo;thou and I must be
      strangers henceforward. Many a gallant stoop have I seen thee make, and
      many a brave heron strike down; but that is all gone and over, and there
      is no hawking more for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, Master Roland,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock the falconer, who came at
      that instant from behind a few alder bushes which had concealed him from
      view, &ldquo;why should there be no more hawking for you? Why, man, what were
      our life without our sports?&mdash;thou know'st the jolly old song&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And rather would Allan in dungeon lie,
  Than live at large where the falcon cannot fly;
  And Allan would rather lie in Sexton's pound,
  Than live where he followed not the merry hawk and hound.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The voice of the falconer was hearty and friendly, and the tone in which
      he half-sung half-recited his rude ballad, implied honest frankness and
      cordiality. But remembrance of their quarrel, and its consequences,
      embarrassed Roland, and prevented his reply. The falconer saw his
      hesitation, and guessed the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Master Roland? do you, who are half an Englishman,
      think that I, who am a whole one, would keep up anger against you, and you
      in distress? That were like some of the Scots, (my master's reverence
      always excepted,) who can be fair and false, and wait their time, and keep
      their mind, as they say, to themselves, and touch pot and flagon with you,
      and hunt and hawk with you, and, after all, when time serves, pay off some
      old feud with the point of the dagger. Canny Yorkshire has no memory for
      such old sores. Why, man, an you had hit me a rough blow, maybe I would
      rather have taken it from you, than a rough word from another; for you
      have a good notion of falconry, though you stand up for washing the meat
      for the eyases. So give us your hand, man, and bear no malice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland, though he felt his proud blood rebel at the familiarity of honest
      Adam's address, could not resist its downright frankness. Covering his
      face with the one hand, he held out the other to the falconer, and
      returned with readiness his friendly grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is hearty now,&rdquo; said Woodcock; &ldquo;I always said you had a kind
      heart, though you have a spice of the devil in your disposition, that is
      certain. I came this way with the falcon on purpose to find you, and yon
      half-bred lubbard told me which way you took flight. You ever thought too
      much of that kestril-kite, Master Roland, and he knows nought of sport
      after all, but what he caught from you. I saw how it had been betwixt you,
      and I sent him out of my company with a wanion&mdash;I would rather have a
      rifler on my perch than a false knave at my elbow&mdash;and now, Master
      Roland, tell me what way wing ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as God pleases,&rdquo; replied the page, with a sigh which he could not
      suppress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, man, never droop a feather for being cast off,&rdquo; said the falconer;
      &ldquo;who knows but you may soar the better and fairer flight for all this yet?&mdash;Look
      at Diamond there, 'tis a noble bird, and shows gallantly with his hood,
      and bells, and jesses; but there is many a wild falcon in Norway that
      would not change properties with him&mdash;And that is what I would say of
      you. You are no longer my Lady's page, and you will not clothe so fair, or
      feed so well, or sleep so soft, or show so gallant&mdash;What of all that?
      if you are not her page, you are your own man, and may go where you will,
      without minding whoop or whistle. The worst is the loss of the sport, but
      who knows what you may come to? They say that Sir Halbert himself, I speak
      with reverence, was once glad to be the Abbot's forester, and now he has
      hounds and hawks of his own, and Adam Woodcock for a falconer to the
      boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, and say well, Adam,&rdquo; answered the youth, the blood
      mantling in his cheeks, &ldquo;the falcon will soar higher without his bells
      than with them, though the bells be made of silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is cheerily spoken,&rdquo; replied the falconer; &ldquo;and whither now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of going to the Abbey of Kennaquhair,&rdquo; answered Roland Graeme,
      &ldquo;to ask the counsel of Father Ambrose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And joy go with you,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;though it is likely you may
      find the old monks in some sorrow; they say the commons are threatening to
      turn them out of their cells, and make a devil's mass of it in the old
      church, thinking they have forborne that sport too long; and troth I am
      clear of the same opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will Father Ambrose be the better of having a friend beside him!&rdquo;
       said the page, manfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but, my young fearnought,&rdquo; replied the falconer, &ldquo;the friend will
      scarce be the better of being beside Father Ambrose&mdash;he may come by
      the redder's lick, and that is ever the worst of the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not for that,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;the dread of a lick should not hold
      me back; but I fear I may bring trouble between the brothers by visiting
      Father Ambrose. I will tarry to-night at Saint Cuthbert's cell, where the
      old priest will give me a night's shelter; and I will send to Father
      Ambrose to ask his advice before I go down to the convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;and that is a likely plan&mdash;and
      now,&rdquo; he continued, exchanging his frankness of manner for a sort of
      awkward embarrassment, as if he had somewhat to say that he had no ready
      means to bring out&mdash;&ldquo;and now, you wot well that I wear a pouch for my
      hawk's meat, [Footnote: This same hag, like every thing belonging to
      falconry, was esteemed an honourable distinction, and worn often by the
      nobility and gentry. One of the Sommervilles of Camnethan was called <i>Sir
      John with the red bag</i>, because it was his wont to wear his hawking
      pouch covered with satin of that colour.] and so forth; but wot you what
      it is lined with, Master Roland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With leather, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Roland, somewhat surprised at the
      hesitation with which Adam Woodcock asked a question apparently so simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With leather, lad?&rdquo; said Woodcock; &ldquo;ay, and with silver to the boot of
      that. See here,&rdquo; he said, showing a secret slit in the lining of his bag
      of office&mdash;&ldquo;here they are, thirty good Harry groats as ever were
      struck in bluff old Hal's time, and ten of them are right heartily at your
      service; and now the murder is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland's first idea was to refuse his assistance; but he recollected the
      vows of humility which he had just taken upon him, and it occurred that
      this was the opportunity to put his new-formed resolution to the test.
      Assuming a strong command of himself, he answered Adam Woodcock with as
      much frankness as his nature permitted him to wear, in doing what was so
      contrary to his inclinations, that he accepted thankfully of his kind
      offer, while, to soothe his own reviving pride, he could not help adding,
      &ldquo;he hoped soon to requite the obligation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That as you list&mdash;that as you list, young man,&rdquo; said the falconer,
      with glee, counting out and delivering to his young friend the supply he
      had so generously offered, and then adding, with great cheerfulness,&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      you may go through the world; for he that can back a horse, wind a horn,
      hollow a greyhound, fly a hawk, and play at sword and buckler, with a
      whole pair of shoes, a green jacket, and ten lily-white groats in his
      pouch, may bid Father Care hang himself in his own jesses. Farewell, and
      God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and as if desirous to avoid the thanks of his companion, he
      turned hastily round, and left Roland Graeme to pursue his journey alone.

  The sacred tapers lights are gone.

</pre>
    <p>
      The cell of Saint Cuthbert, as it was called, marked, or was supposed to
      mark, one of those resting-places, which that venerable saint was pleased
      to assign to his monks, when his convent, being driven from Lindisfern by
      the Danes, became a peripatetic society of religionists, and bearing their
      patron's body on their shoulders, transported him from place to place
      through Scotland and the borders of England, until he was pleased at
      length to spare them the pain of carrying him farther, and to choose his
      ultimate place of rest in the lordly towers of Durham. The odour of his
      sanctity remained behind him at each place where he had granted the monks
      a transient respite from their labours; and proud were those who could
      assign, as his temporary resting-place, any spot within their vicinity.
      There were few cells more celebrated and honoured than that of Saint
      Cuthbert, to which Roland Graeme now bent his way, situated considerably
      to the north-west of the great Abbey of Kennaquhair, on which it was
      dependent. In the neighbourhood were some of those recommendations which
      weighed with the experienced priesthood of Rome, in choosing their sites
      for places of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a well, possessed of some medicinal qualities, which, of course,
      claimed the saint for its guardian and patron, and occasionally produced
      some advantage to the recluse who inhabited his cell, since none could
      reasonably expect to benefit by the fountain who did not extend their
      bounty to the saint's chaplain. A few rods of fertile land afforded the
      monk his plot of garden ground; an eminence well clothed with trees rose
      behind the cell, and sheltered it from, the north and the east, while the
      front, opening to the south-west, looked up a wild but pleasant valley,
      down which wandered a lively brook, which battled with every stone that
      interrupted its passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cell itself was rather plainly than rudely constructed&mdash;a low
      Gothic building with two small apartments, one of which served the priest
      for his dwelling-place, the other for his chapel. As there were few of the
      secular clergy who durst venture to reside so near the Border, the
      assistance of this monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless to the
      community, while the Catholic religion retained the ascendancy; as he
      could marry, christen, and administer the other sacraments of the Roman
      church. Of late, however, as the Protestant doctrines gained ground, he
      had found it convenient to live in close retirement, and to avoid, as much
      as possible, drawing upon himself observation or animadversion. The
      appearance of his habitation, however, when Roland Graeme came before it
      in the close of the evening, plainly showed that his caution had been
      finally ineffectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page's first movement was to knock at the door, when he observed, to
      his surprise, that it was open, not from being left unlatched, but
      because, beat off its upper hinge, it was only fastened to the door-post
      by the lower, and could therefore no longer perform its functions.
      Somewhat alarmed at this, and receiving no answer when he knocked and
      called, Roland began to look more at leisure upon the exterior of the
      little dwelling before he ventured to enter it. The flowers, which had
      been trained with care against the walls, seemed to have been recently
      torn down, and trailed their dishonoured garlands on the earth; the
      latticed window was broken and dashed in. The garden, which the monk had
      maintained by his constant labour in the highest order and beauty, bore
      marks of having been lately trod down and destroyed by the hoofs of
      animals, and the feet of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sainted spring had not escaped. It was wont to rise beneath a canopy
      of ribbed arches, with which the devotion of elder times had secured and
      protected its healing waters. These arches were now almost entirely
      demolished, and the stones of which they were built were tumbled into the
      well, as if for the purpose of choking up and destroying the fountain,
      which, as it had shared in other days the honour of the saint, was, in the
      present, doomed to partake his unpopularity. Part of the roof had been
      pulled down from the house itself, and an attempt had been made with crows
      and levers upon one of the angles, by which several large corner-stones
      had been forced out of their place; but the solidity of ancient mason-work
      had proved too great for the time or patience of the assailants, and they
      had relinquished their task of destruction. Such dilapidated buildings,
      after the lapse of years, during which nature has gradually covered the
      effects of violence with creeping plants, and with weather-stains,
      exhibit, amid their decay, a melancholy beauty. But when the visible
      effects of violence appear raw and recent, there is no feeling to mitigate
      the sense of devastation with which they impress the spectators; and such
      was now the scene on which the youthful page gazed, with the painful
      feelings it was qualified to excite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his first momentary surprise was over, Roland Graeme was at no loss
      to conjecture the cause of these ravages. The destruction of the Popish
      edifices did not take place at once throughout Scotland, but at different
      times, and according to the spirit which actuated the reformed clergy;
      some of whom instigated their hearers to these acts of demolition, and
      others, with better taste and feeling, endeavoured to protect the ancient
      shrines, while they desired to see them purified from the objects which
      had attracted idolatrous devotion. From time to time, therefore, the
      populace of the Scottish towns and villages, when instigated either by
      their own feelings of abhorrence for Popish superstition, or by the
      doctrines of the more zealous preachers, resumed the work of destruction,
      and exercised it upon some sequestered church, chapel, or cell, which had
      escaped the first burst of their indignation against the religion of Rome.
      In many places, the vices of the Catholic clergy, arising out of the
      wealth and the corruption of that tremendous hierarchy, furnished too good
      an apology for wreaking vengeance upon the splendid edifices which they
      inhabited; and of this an old Scottish historian gives a remarkable
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why mourn ye,&rdquo; said an aged matron, seeing the discontent of some of the
      citizens, while a stately convent was burnt by the multitude,&mdash;&ldquo;why
      mourn ye for its destruction? If you knew half the flagitious wickedness
      which has been perpetrated within that house, you would rather bless the
      divine judgment, which permits not even the senseless walls that screened
      such profligacy, any longer to cumber Christian ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But although, in many instances, the destruction of the Roman Catholic
      buildings might be, in the matron's way of judging, an act of justice, and
      in others an act of policy, there is no doubt that the humour of
      demolishing monuments of ancient piety and munificence, and that in a poor
      country like Scotland, where there was no chance of their being replaced,
      was both useless, mischievous, and barbarous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance, the unpretending and quiet seclusion of the monk
      of Saint Cuthbert's had hitherto saved him from the general wreck; but it
      would seem ruin had now at length reached him. Anxious to discover if he
      had at least escaped personal harm, Roland Graeme entered the half ruined
      cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the building was in a state which fully justified the
      opinion he had formed from its external injuries. The few rude utensils of
      the solitary's hut were broken down, and lay scattered on the floor, where
      it seemed as if a fire had been made with some of the fragments to destroy
      the rest of his property, and to consume, in particular, the rude old
      image of Saint Cuthbert, in its episcopal habit, which lay on the hearth
      like Dagon of yore, shattered with the axe and scorched with the flames,
      but only partially destroyed. In the little apartment which served as a
      chapel, the altar was overthrown, and the four huge stones of which it had
      been once composed lay scattered around the floor. The large stone
      crucifix which occupied the niche behind the altar, and fronted the
      supplicant while he paid his devotion there, had been pulled down and
      dashed by its own weight into three fragments. There were marks of
      sledge-hammers on each of these; yet the image had been saved from utter
      demolition by the size and strength of the remaining fragments, which,
      though much injured, retained enough of the original sculpture to show
      what it had been intended to represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: I may here observe, that this is entirely an ideal scene. Saint
      Cuthbert, a person of established sanctity, had, no doubt, several places
      of worship on the Borders, where he flourished whilst living; but
      Tillmouth Chapel is the only one which bears some resemblance to the
      hermitage described in the text. It has, indeed, a well, famous for
      gratifying three wishes for every worshipper who shall quaff the fountain
      with sufficient belief in its efficacy. At this spot the Saint is said to
      have landed in his stone coffin, in which he sailed down the Tweed from
      Melrose and here the stone coffin long lay, in evidence of the fact. The
      late Sir Francis Blake Delaval is said to have taken the exact measure of
      the coffin, and to have ascertained, by hydrostatic principles, that it
      might have actually swum. A profane farmer in the neighborhood announced
      his intention of converting this last bed of the Saint into a trough for
      his swine; but the profanation was rendered impossible, either by the
      Saint, or by some pious votary in his behalf, for on the following morning
      the stone sarcophargus was found broken in two fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tillmouth Chapel, with these points of resemblance, lies, however, in
      exactly the opposite direction as regards Melrose, which the supposed cell
      of St. Cuthbert is said to have borne towards Kennaquhair.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme, secretly nursed in the tenets of Rome, saw with horror the
      profanation of the most sacred emblem, according to his creed, of our holy
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the badge of our redemption,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which the felons have dared
      to violate&mdash;would to God my weak strength were able to replace it&mdash;my
      humble strength, to atone for the sacrilege!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to the task he first meditated, and with a sudden, and to
      himself almost an incredible exertion of power, he lifted up the one
      extremity of the lower shaft of the cross, and rested it upon the edge of
      the large stone which served for its pedestal. Encouraged by this success,
      he applied his force to the other extremity, and, to his own astonishment,
      succeeded so far as to erect the lower end of the limb into the socket,
      out of which it had been forced, and to place this fragment of the image
      upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was employed in this labour, or rather at the very moment when he
      had accomplished the elevation of the fragment, a voice, in thrilling and
      well-known accents, spoke behind him these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Well done, thou
      good and faithful servant! Thus would I again meet the child of my love&mdash;the
      hope of my aged eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland turned round in astonishment, and the tall commanding form of
      Magdalen Graeme stood beside him. She was arrayed in a sort of loose
      habit, in form like that worn by penitents in Catholic countries, but
      black in colour, and approaching as near to a pilgrim's cloak as it was
      safe to wear in a country where the suspicion of Catholic devotion in many
      places endangered the safety of those who were suspected of attachment to
      the ancient faith. Roland Graeme threw himself at her feet. She raised and
      embraced him, with affection indeed, but not unmixed with gravity which
      amounted almost to sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast kept well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the bird in thy bosom. [Footnote: An
      expression used by Sir Ralph Percy, slain in the battle of Hedgly-moor in
      1464, when dying, to express his having preserved unstained his fidelity
      to the house of Lancaster.] As a boy, as a youth, thou hast held fast thy
      faith amongst heretics&mdash;thou hast kept thy secret and mine own
      amongst thine enemies. I wept when I parted from you&mdash;I who seldom
      weep, then shed tears, less for thy death than for thy spiritual danger&mdash;I
      dared not even see thee to bid thee a last farewell&mdash;my grief, my
      swelling grief, had betrayed me to these heretics. But thou hast been
      faithful&mdash;down, down on thy knees before the holy sign, which evil
      men injure and blaspheme; down, and praise saints and angels for the grace
      they have done thee, in preserving thee from the leprous plague which
      cleaves to the house in which thou wert nurtured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, my mother&mdash;so I must ever call you&rdquo; replied Graeme,&mdash;&ldquo;if I
      am returned such as thou wouldst wish me, thou must thank the care of the
      pious father Ambrose, whose instructions confirmed your early precepts,
      and taught me at once to be faithful and to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be he blessed for it,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;blessed in the cell and in the field,
      in the pulpit and at the altar&mdash;the saints rain blessings on him!&mdash;they
      are just, and employ his pious care to counteract the evils which his
      detested brother works against the realm and the church,&mdash;but he knew
      not of thy lineage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not myself tell him that,&rdquo; answered Roland. &ldquo;I knew but darkly
      from your words, that Sir Halbert Glendinning holds mine inheritance, and
      that I am of blood as noble as runs in the veins of any Scottish Baron&mdash;these
      are things not to be forgotten, but for the explanation I must now look to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when time suits, thou shalt not look for it in vain. But men say, my
      son, that thou art bold and sudden; and those who bear such tempers are
      not lightly to be trusted with what will strongly move them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather, my mother,&rdquo; returned Roland Graeme, &ldquo;that I am laggard and
      cold-blooded&mdash;what patience or endurance can you require of which <i>he</i>
      is not capable, who for years has heard his religion ridiculed and
      insulted, yet failed to plunge his dagger into the blasphemer's bosom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be contented, my child,&rdquo; replied Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;the time, which then
      and even now demands patience, will soon ripen to that of effort and
      action&mdash;great events are on the wing, and thou,&mdash;thou shalt have
      thy share in advancing them. Thou hast relinquished the service of the
      Lady of Avenel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been dismissed from it, my mother&mdash;I have lived to be
      dismissed, as if I were the meanest of the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the better, my child,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;thy mind will be the more
      hardened to undertake that which must be performed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be nothing, then, against the Lady of Avenel,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;as
      thy look and words seem to imply. I have eaten her bread&mdash;I have
      experienced her favour&mdash;I will neither injure nor betray her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that hereafter, my son,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but learn this, that it is not for
      thee to capitulate in thy duty, and to say this will I do, and that will I
      leave undone&mdash;No, Roland! God and man will no longer abide the
      wickedness of this generation. Seest thou these fragments&mdash;knowest
      thou what they represent?&mdash;and canst thou think it is for thee to
      make distinctions amongst a race so accursed by Heaven, that they
      renounce, violate, blaspheme, and destroy, whatsoever we are commanded to
      believe in, whatsoever we are commanded to reverence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she bent her head towards the broken image, with a
      countenance in which strong resentment and zeal were mingled with an
      expression of ecstatic devotion; she raised her left hand aloft as in the
      act of making a vow, and thus proceeded; &ldquo;Bear witness for me, blessed
      symbol of our salvation, bear witness, holy saint, within whose violated
      temple we stand, that as it is not for vengeance of my own that my hate
      pursues these people, so neither, for any favour or earthly affection
      towards any amongst them, will I withdraw my hand from the plough, when it
      shall pass through the devoted furrow! Bear witness, holy saint, once
      thyself a wanderer and fugitive as we are now&mdash;bear witness, Mother
      of Mercy, Queen of Heaven&mdash;bear witness, saints and angels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this high train of enthusiasm, she stood, raising her eyes through the
      fractured roof of the vault, to the stars which now began to twinkle
      through the pale twilight, while the long gray tresses which hung down
      over her shoulders waved in the night-breeze, which the chasm and
      fractured windows admitted freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme was too much awed by early habits, as well as by the
      mysterious import of her words, to ask for farther explanation of the
      purpose she obscurely hinted at. Nor did she farther press him on the
      subject; for, having concluded her prayer or obtestation, by clasping her
      hands together with solemnity, and then signing herself with the cross,
      she again addressed her grandson, in a tone more adapted to the ordinary
      business of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must hence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Roland, thou must hence, but not till
      morning&mdash;And now, how wilt thou shift for thy night's quarters?&mdash;thou
      hast been more softly bred than when we were companions in the misty hills
      of Cumberland and Liddesdale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have at least preserved, my good mother, the habits which I then
      learned&mdash;can lie hard, feed sparingly, and think it no hardship.
      Since I was a wanderer with thee on the hills, I have been a hunter, and
      fisher, and fowler, and each of these is accustomed to sleep freely in a
      worse shelter than sacrilege has left us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than sacrilege has left us here!&rdquo; said the matron, repeating his words,
      and pausing on them. &ldquo;Most true, my son; and God's faithful children are
      now worst sheltered, when they lodge in God's own house and the demesne of
      his blessed saints. We shall sleep cold here, under the nightwind, which
      whistles through the breaches which heresy has made. They shall lie warmer
      who made them&mdash;ay, and through a long hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the wild and singular expression of this female, she
      appeared to retain towards Roland Graeme, in a strong degree, that
      affectionate and sedulous love which women bear to their nurslings, and
      the children dependent on their care. It seemed as if she would not permit
      him to do aught for himself which in former days her attention had been
      used to do for him, and that she considered the tall stripling before her
      as being equally dependent on her careful attention as when he was the
      orphan child, who had owed all to her affectionate solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hast thou to eat now?&rdquo; she said, as, leaving the chapel, they went
      into the deserted habitation of the priest; &ldquo;or what means of kindling a
      fire, to defend thee from this raw and inclement air? Poor child! thou
      hast made slight provision for a long journey; nor hast thou skill to help
      thyself by wit, when means are scanty. But Our Lady has placed by thy side
      one to whom want, in all its forms, is as familiar as plenty and splendour
      have formerly been. And with want, Roland, come the arts of which she is
      the inventor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an active and officious diligence, which strangely contrasted with
      her late abstracted and high tone of Catholic devotion, she set about her
      domestic arrangements for the evening. A pouch, which was hidden under her
      garment, produced a flint and steel, and from the scattered fragments
      around (those pertaining to the image of Saint Cuthbert scrupulously
      excepted) she obtained splinters sufficient to raise a sparkling and
      cheerful fire on the hearth of the deserted cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for needful food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of it, mother,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;unless you yourself feel hunger.
      It is a little thing for me to endure a night's abstinence, and a small
      atonement for the necessary transgression of the rules of the Church upon
      which I was compelled during my stay in the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunger for myself!&rdquo; answered the matron&mdash;&ldquo;Know, youth, that a mother
      knows not hunger till that of her child is satisfied.&rdquo; And with
      affectionate inconsistency, totally different from her usual manner, she
      added, &ldquo;Roland, you must not fast; you have dispensation; you are young,
      and to youth food and sleep are necessaries not to be dispensed with.
      Husband your strength, my child,&mdash;your sovereign, your religion, your
      country, require it. Let age macerate by fast and vigil a body which can
      only suffer; let youth, in these active times, nourish the limbs and the
      strength which action requires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she thus spoke, the scrip, which had produced the means of striking
      fire, furnished provision for a meal; of which she herself scarce partook,
      but anxiously watched her charge, taking a pleasure, resembling that of an
      epicure, in each morsel which he swallowed with a youthful appetite which
      abstinence had rendered unusually sharp. Roland readily obeyed her
      recommendations, and ate the food which she so affectionately and
      earnestly placed before him. But she shook her head when invited by him in
      return to partake of the refreshment her own cares had furnished; and when
      his solicitude became more pressing, she refused him in a loftier tone of
      rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know not to whom or of what you speak. They to
      whom Heaven declares its purpose must merit its communication by
      mortifying the senses; they have that within which requires not the
      superfluity of earthly nutriment, which is necessary to those who are
      without the sphere of the Vision. To them the watch spent in prayer is a
      refreshing slumber, and the sense of doing the will of Heaven is a richer
      banquet than the tables of monarchs can spread before them!&mdash;But do
      thou sleep soft, my son,&rdquo; she said, relapsing from the tone of fanaticism
      into that of maternal affection and tenderness; &ldquo;do thou sleep sound while
      life is but young with thee, and the cares of the day can be drowned in
      the slumbers of the evening. Different is thy duty and mine, and as
      different the means by which we must qualify and strengthen ourselves to
      perform it. From thee is demanded strength of body&mdash;from me, strength
      of soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she thus spoke, she prepared with ready address a pallet-couch,
      composed partly of the dried leaves which had once furnished a bed to the
      solitary, and the guests who occasionally received his hospitality, and
      which, neglected by the destroyers of his humble cell, had remained little
      disturbed in the corner allotted for them. To these her care added some of
      the vestures which lay torn and scattered on the floor. With a zealous
      hand she selected all such as appeared to have made any part of the
      sacerdotal vestments, laying them aside as sacred from ordinary purposes,
      and with the rest she made, with dexterous promptness, such a bed as a
      weary man might willingly stretch himself on; and during the time she was
      preparing it, rejected, even with acrimony, any attempt which the youth
      made to assist her, or any entreaty which he urged, that she would accept
      of the place of rest for her own use. &ldquo;Sleep thou,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Roland
      Graeme, sleep thou&mdash;the persecuted, the disinherited orphan&mdash;the
      son of an ill-fated mother&mdash;sleep thou! I go to pray in the chapel
      beside thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manner was too enthusiastically earnest, too obstinately firm, to
      permit Roland Graeme to dispute her will any farther. Yet he felt some
      shame in giving way to it. It seemed as if she had forgotten the years
      that had passed away since their parting; and expected to meet, in the
      tall, indulged, and wilful youth, whom she had recovered, the passive
      obedience of the child whom she had left in the Castle of Avenel. This did
      not fail to hurt her grandson's characteristic and constitutional pride.
      He obeyed, indeed, awed into submission by the sudden recurrence of former
      subordination, and by feelings of affection and gratitude. Still, however,
      he felt the yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I relinquished the hawk and the hound,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to become the
      pupil of her pleasure, as if I were still a child?&mdash;I, whom even my
      envious mates allowed to be superior in those exercises which they took
      most pains to acquire, and which came to me naturally, as if a knowledge
      of them had been my birthright? This may not, and must not be. I will be
      no reclaimed sparrow-hawk, who is carried hooded on a woman's wrist, and
      has his quarry only shown to him when his eyes are uncovered for his
      flight. I will know her purpose ere it is proposed to me to aid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These, and other thoughts, streamed through the mind of Roland Graeme; and
      although wearied with the fatigues of the day, it was long ere he could
      compose himself to rest.

  Kneel with me&mdash;swear it&mdash;'tis not in words I trust,
  Save when they're fenced with an appeal to Heaven.
                                   OLD PLAY
</pre>
    <p>
      After passing the night in that sound sleep for which agitation and
      fatigue had prepared him, Roland was awakened by the fresh morning air,
      and by the beams of the rising sun. His first feeling was that of
      surprise; for, instead of looking forth from a turret window on the Lake
      of Avenel, which was the prospect his former apartment afforded, an
      unlatticed aperture gave him the view of the demolished garden of the
      banished anchorite. He sat up on his couch of leaves, and arranged in his
      memory, not without wonder, the singular events of the preceding day,
      which appeared the more surprising the more he considered them. He had
      lost the protectress of his youth, and, in the same day, he had recovered
      the guide and guardian of his childhood. The former deprivation he felt
      ought to be matter of unceasing regret, and it seemed as if the latter
      could hardly be the subject of unmixed self-congratulation. He remembered
      this person, who had stood to him in the relation of a mother, as equally
      affectionate in her attention, and absolute in her authority. A singular
      mixture of love and fear attended upon his early remembrances as they were
      connected with her; and the fear that she might desire to resume the same
      absolute control over his motions&mdash;a fear which her conduct of
      yesterday did not tend much to dissipate&mdash;weighed heavily against the
      joy of this second meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot mean,&rdquo; said his rising pride, &ldquo;to lead and direct me as a
      pupil, when I am at the age of judging of my own actions?&mdash;this she
      cannot mean, or meaning it, will feel herself strangely deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sense of gratitude towards the person against whom his heart thus
      rebelled, checked his course of feeling. He resisted the thoughts which
      involuntarily arose in his mind, as he would have resisted an actual
      instigation of the foul fiend; and, to aid him in his struggle, he felt
      for his beads. But, in his hasty departure from the Castle of Avenel, he
      had forgotten and left them behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is yet worse,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but two things I learned of her under the
      most deadly charge of secrecy&mdash;to tell my beads, and to conceal that
      I did so; and I have kept my word till now; and when she shall ask me for
      the rosary, I must say I have forgotten it! Do I deserve she should
      believe me when. I say I have kept the secret of my faith, when I set so
      light by its symbol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paced the floor in anxious agitation. In fact, his attachment to his
      faith was of a nature very different from that which animated the
      enthusiastic matron, but which, notwithstanding, it would have been his
      last thought to relinquish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early charges impressed on him by his grandmother, had been instilled
      into a mind and memory of a character peculiarly tenacious. Child as he
      was, he was proud of the confidence reposed in his discretion, and
      resolved to show that it had not been rashly intrusted to him. At the same
      time, his resolution was no more than that of a child, and must,
      necessarily, have gradually faded away under the operation both of precept
      and example, during his residence at the Castle of Avenel, but for the
      exhortations of Father Ambrose, who, in his lay estate, had been called
      Edward Glendinning. This zealous monk had been apprized, by an unsigned
      letter placed in his hand by a pilgrim, that a child educated in the
      Catholic faith was now in the Castle of Avenel, perilously situated, (so
      was the scroll expressed,) as ever the three children who were cast into
      the fiery furnace of persecution. The letter threw upon Father Ambrose the
      fault, should this solitary lamb, unwillingly left within the demesnes of
      the prowling wolf, become his final prey. There needed no farther
      exhortation to the monk than the idea that a soul might be endangered, and
      that a Catholic might become an apostate; and he made his visits more
      frequent than usual to the castle of Avenel, lest, through want of the
      private encouragement and instruction which he always found some
      opportunity of dispensing, the church should lose a proselyte, and,
      according to the Romish creed, the devil acquire a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still these interviews were rare; and though they encouraged the solitary
      boy to keep his secret and hold fast his religion, they were neither
      frequent nor long enough to inspire him with any thing beyond a blind
      attachment to the observances which the priest recommended. He adhered to
      the forms of his religion rather because he felt it would be dishonourable
      to change that of his fathers, than from any rational conviction or
      sincere belief of its mysterious doctrines. It was a principal part of the
      distinction which, in his own opinion, singled him out from those with
      whom he lived, and gave him an additional, though an internal and
      concealed reason, for contemning those of the household who showed an
      undisguised dislike of him, and for hardening himself against the
      instructions of the chaplain, Henry Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fanatic preacher,&rdquo; he thought within himself, during some one of the
      chaplain's frequent discourses against the Church of Rome, &ldquo;he little
      knows whose ears are receiving his profane doctrine, and with what
      contempt and abhorrence they hear his blasphemies against the holy
      religion by which kings have been crowned, and for which martyrs have
      died!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in such proud feelings of defiance of heresy, as it was termed, and of
      its professors, which associated the Catholic religion with a sense of
      generous independence, and that of the Protestants with the subjugation of
      his mind and temper to the direction of Mr. Warden, began and ended the
      faith of Roland Graeme, who, independently of the pride of singularity,
      sought not to understand, and had no one to expound to him, the
      peculiarities of the tenets which he professed. His regret, therefore, at
      missing the rosary which had been conveyed to him through the hands of
      Father Ambrose, was rather the shame of a soldier who has dropped his
      cockade, or badge of service, than that of a zealous votary who had
      forgotten a visible symbol of his religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts on the subject, however, were mortifying, and the more so
      from apprehension that his negligence must reach the ears of his relative.
      He felt it could be no one but her who had secretly transmitted these
      beads to Father Ambrose for his use, and that his carelessness was but an
      indifferent requital of her kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor will she omit to ask me about them,&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;for hers is
      a zeal which age cannot quell; and if she has not quitted her wont, my
      answer will not fail to incense her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he thus communed with himself, Magdalen Graeme entered the
      apartment. &ldquo;The blessing of the morning on your youthful head, my son,&rdquo;
       she said, with a solemnity of expression which thrilled the youth to the
      heart, so sad and earnest did the benediction flow from her lips, in a
      tone where devotion was blended with affection. &ldquo;And thou hast started
      thus early from thy couch to catch the first breath of the dawn? But it is
      not well, my Roland. Enjoy slumber while thou canst; the time is not far
      behind when the waking eye must be thy portion, as well as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered these words with an affectionate and anxious tone, which
      showed, that devotional as were the habitual exercises of her mind, the
      thoughts of her nursling yet bound her to earth with the cords of human
      affection and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she abode not long in a mood which she probably regarded as a
      momentary dereliction of her imaginary high calling&mdash;&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;youth, up and be doing&mdash;It is time that we leave this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whither do we go?&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;or what is the object of our
      journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matron stepped back, and gazed on him with surprise, not unmingled
      with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what purpose such a question?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;is it not enough that I lead
      the way? Hast thou lived with heretics till thou hast learned to instal
      the vanity of thine own private judgment in place of due honour and
      obedience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time,&rdquo; thought Roland Graeme within himself, &ldquo;is already come, when I
      must establish my freedom, or be a willing thrall for ever&mdash;I feel
      that I must speedily look to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She instantly fulfilled his foreboding, by recurring to the theme by which
      her thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed, although, when she pleased,
      no one could so perfectly disguise her religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy beads, my son&mdash;hast thou told thy beads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme coloured high; he felt the storm was approaching, but
      scorned to avert it by a falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten my rosary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at the Castle of Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten thy rosary!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;false both to religion and to
      natural duty, hast thou lost what was sent so far, and at such risk, a
      token of the truest affection, that should have been, every bead of it, as
      dear to thee as thine eyeballs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved it should have so chanced, mother,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;and
      much did I value the token, as coming from you. For what remains, I trust
      to win gold enough, when I push my way in the world; and till then, beads
      of black oak, or a rosary of nuts, must serve the turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; said his grandmother; &ldquo;young as he is, he hath learned already
      the lessons of the devil's school! The rosary, consecrated by the Holy
      Father himself, and sanctified by his blessing, is but a few knobs of
      gold, whose value may be replaced by the wages of his profane labour, and
      whose virtue may be supplied by a string of hazel-nuts!&mdash;This is
      heresy&mdash;So Henry Warden, the wolf who ravages the flock of the
      Shepherd, hath taught thee to speak and to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I am no heretic; I believe and I pray
      according to the rules of our church&mdash;This misfortune I regret, but I
      cannot amend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst repent it, though,&rdquo; replied his spiritual directress, &ldquo;repent
      it in dust and ashes, atone for it by fasting, prayer, and penance,
      instead of looking on me with a countenance as light as if thou hadst lost
      but a button from thy cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;be appeased; I will remember my fault in the next
      confession which I have space and opportunity to make, and will do
      whatever the priest may require of me in atonement. For the heaviest fault
      I can do no more.&mdash;But, mother,&rdquo; he added, after a moment's pause,
      &ldquo;let me not incur your farther displeasure, if I ask whither our journey
      is bound, and what is its object. I am no longer a child, but a man, and
      at my own disposal, with down upon my chin, and a sword by my side&mdash;I
      will go to the end of the world with you to do your pleasure; but I owe it
      to myself to inquire the purpose and direction of our travels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe it to yourself, ungrateful boy?&rdquo; replied his relative, passion
      rapidly supplying the colour which age had long chased from her features,&mdash;&ldquo;to
      yourself you owe nothing&mdash;you can owe nothing&mdash;to me you owe
      every thing&mdash;your life when an infant&mdash;your support while a
      child&mdash;the means of instruction, and the hopes of honour&mdash;and,
      sooner than thou shouldst abandon the noble cause to which I have devoted
      thee, would I see thee lie a corpse at my feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland was alarmed at the vehement agitation with which she spoke, and
      which threatened to overpower her aged frame; and he hastened to reply,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      forget nothing of what I owe to you, my dearest mother&mdash;show me how
      my blood can testify my gratitude, and you shall judge if I spare it. But
      blindfold obedience has in it as little merit as reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints and angels!&rdquo; replied Magdalen, &ldquo;and do I hear these words from the
      child of my hopes, the nursling by whose bed I have kneeled, and for whose
      weal I have wearied every saint in heaven with prayers? Roland, by
      obedience only canst thou show thy affection and thy gratitude. What
      avails it that you might perchance adopt the course I propose to thee,
      were it to be fully explained? Thou wouldst not then follow my command,
      but thine own judgment; thou wouldst not do the will of Heaven,
      communicated through thy best friend, to whom thou owest thine all; but
      thou wouldst observe the blinded dictates of thine own imperfect reason.
      Hear me, Roland! a lot calls thee&mdash;solicits thee&mdash;demands thee&mdash;the
      proudest to which man can be destined, and it uses the voice of thine
      earliest, thy best, thine only friend&mdash;Wilt thou resist it? Then go
      thy way&mdash;leave me here&mdash;my hopes on earth are gone and withered&mdash;I
      will kneel me down before yonder profaned altar, and when the raging
      heretics return, they shall dye it with the blood of a martyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dearest mother,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, whose early recollections of
      her violence were formidably renewed by these wild expressions of reckless
      passion, &ldquo;I will not forsake you&mdash;I will abide with you&mdash;worlds
      shall not force me from your side&mdash;I will protect&mdash;I will defend
      you&mdash;I will live with you, and die for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, my son, were worth all these&mdash;say only, 'I will obey
      you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt it not, mother,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;I will, and that with all my
      heart; only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I receive no qualifications of thy promise,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme,
      catching at the word, &ldquo;the obedience which I require is absolute; and a
      blessing on thee, thou darling memory of my beloved child, that thou hast
      power to make a promise so hard to human pride! Trust me well, that in the
      design in which thou dost embark, thou hast for thy partners the mighty
      and the valiant, the power of the church, and the pride of the noble.
      Succeed or fail, live or die, thy name shall be among those with whom
      success or failure is alike glorious, death or life alike desirable.
      Forward, then, forward! life is short, and our plan is laborious&mdash;Angels,
      saints, and the whole blessed host of heaven, have their eyes even now on
      this barren and blighted land of Scotland&mdash;What say I? on Scotland?
      their eye is on <i>us</i>, Roland&mdash;on the frail woman, on the
      inexperienced youth, who, amidst the ruins which sacrilege hath made in
      the holy place, devote themselves to God's cause, and that of their lawful
      Sovereign. Amen, so be it! The blessed eyes of saints and martyrs, which
      see our resolve, shall witness the execution; or their ears, which hear
      our vow, shall hear our death-groan, drawn in the sacred cause!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While thus speaking, she held Roland Graeme firmly with one hand, while
      she pointed upward with the other, to leave him, as it were, no means of
      protest against the obtestation to which he was thus made a party. When
      she had finished her appeal to Heaven, she left him no leisure for farther
      hesitation, or for asking any explanation of her purpose; but passing with
      the same ready transition as formerly, to the solicitous attentions of an
      anxious parent, overwhelmed him with questions concerning his residence in
      the Castle of Avenel, and the qualities and accomplishments he had
      acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; she said, when she had exhausted her inquiries, &ldquo;my gay
      goss-hawk
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The comparison is taken from some beautiful verses in an old
      ballad, entitled Fause Foodrage, published in the &ldquo;Minstrelsy of the
      Scottish Border.&rdquo; A deposed queen, to preserve her infant son from the
      traitors who have slain his father, exchanges him with the female
      offspring of a faithful friend, and goes on to direct the education of the
      children, and the private signals by which the parents are to hear news
      each of her own offspring.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;And you shall learn my gay goss-hawk
  Right well to breast a steed;
  And so will I your turtle dow,
  As well to write and read.

  And ye shall learn my gay goss-hawk
  To wield both bow and brand;
  And so will I your turtle dow,
  To lay gowd with her hand.

  At kirk or market when we meet,
  We'll dare make no avow,
  But, 'Dame, how does my gay goss-hawk?'
  'Madame, how does my dow?'&rdquo; ]
</pre>
    <p>
      hath been well trained, and will soar high; but those who bred him will
      have cause to fear as well as to wonder at his flight.&mdash;Let us now,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;to our morning meal, and care not though it be a scanty one. A
      few hours' walk will bring us to more friendly quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They broke their fast accordingly, on such fragments as remained of their
      yesterday's provision, and immediately set out on their farther journey.
      Magdalen Graeme led the way, with a firm and active step much beyond her
      years, and Roland Graeme followed, pensive and anxious, and far from
      satisfied with the state of dependence to which he seemed again to be
      reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I for ever,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;to be devoured with the desire of
      independence and free agency, and yet to be for ever led on, by
      circumstances, to follow the will of others?&rdquo;

  She dwelt unnoticed and alone,
    Beside the springs of Dove:
  A maid whom there was none to praise,
    And very few to love.
                        WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the course of their journey the travellers spoke little to each other.
      Magdalen Graeme chanted, from time to time, in a low voice, a part of some
      one of those beautiful old Latin hymns which belong to the Catholic
      service, muttered an Ave or a Credo, and so passed on, lost in devotional
      contemplation. The meditations of her grandson were more bent on mundane
      matters; and many a time, as a moor-fowl arose from the heath, and shot
      along the moor, uttering his bold crow of defiance, he thought of the
      jolly Adam Woodcock, and his trusty goss-hawk; or, as they passed a
      thicket where the low trees and bushes were intermingled with tall fern,
      furze, and broom, so as to form a thick and intricate cover, his dreams
      were of a roebuck and a brace of gaze-hounds. But frequently his mind
      returned to the benevolent and kind mistress whom he had left behind him,
      offended justly, and unreconciled by any effort of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My step would be lighter,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and so would my heart, could I
      but have returned to see her for one instant, and to say, Lady, the orphan
      boy was wild, but not ungrateful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Travelling in these divers moods, about the hour of noon they reached a
      small straggling village, in which, as usual, were seen one or two of
      those predominating towers, or peel houses, which, for reasons of defence
      elsewhere detailed, were at that time to be found in every Border hamlet.
      A brook flowed beside the village, and watered the valley in which it
      stood. There was also a mansion at the end of the village, and a little
      way separated from it, much dilapidated, and in very bad order, but
      appearing to have been the abode of persons of some consideration. The
      situation was agreeable, being an angle formed by the stream, bearing
      three or four large sycamore trees, which were in full leaf, and served to
      relieve the dark appearance of the mansion, which was built of a deep red
      stone. The house itself was a large one, but was now obviously too big for
      the inmates; several windows were built up, especially those which opened
      from the lower story; others were blockaded in a less substantial manner.
      The court before the door, which had once been defended with a species of
      low outer-wall, now ruinous, was paved, but the stones were completely
      covered with long gray nettles, thistles, and other weeds, which, shooting
      up betwixt the flags, had displaced many of them from their level. Even
      matters demanding more peremptory attention had been left neglected, in a
      manner which argued sloth or poverty in the extreme. The stream,
      undermining a part of the bank near an angle of the ruinous wall, had
      brought it down, with a corner turret, the ruins of which lay in the bed
      of the river. The current, interrupted by the ruins which it had
      overthrown, and turned yet nearer to the site of the tower, had greatly
      enlarged the breach it had made, and was in the process of undermining the
      ground on which the house itself stood, unless it were speedily protected
      by sufficient bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this attracted Roland Graeme's observation, as they approached the
      dwelling by a winding path, which gave them, at intervals, a view of it
      from different points.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we go to yonder house,&rdquo; he said to his mother, &ldquo;I trust it is but for
      a short visit. It looks as if two rainy days from the north-west would
      send the whole into the brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see but with the eyes of the body,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;God will
      defend his own, though it be forsaken and despised of men. Better to dwell
      on the sand, under his law, than fly to the rock of human trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she thus spoke, they entered the court before the old mansion, and
      Roland could observe that the front of it had formerly been considerably
      ornamented with carved work, in the same dark-coloured freestone of which
      it was built. But all these ornaments had been broken down and destroyed,
      and only the shattered vestiges of niches and entablatures now strewed the
      place which they had once occupied. The larger entrance in front was
      walled up, but a little footpath, which, from its appearance, seemed to be
      rarely trodden, led to a small wicket, defended by a door well clenched
      with iron-headed nails, at which Magdalen Graeme knocked three times,
      pausing betwixt each knock, until she heard an answering tap from within.
      At the last knock, the wicket was opened by a pale thin female, who said,
      &ldquo;<i>Benedicti qui venient in nomine Domini</i>.&rdquo; They entered, and the
      portress hastily shut behind them the wicket, and made fast the massive
      fastenings by which it was secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female led the way through a narrow entrance, into a vestibule of some
      extent, paved with stone, and having benches of the same solid material
      ranged around. At the upper end was an oriel window, but some of the
      intervals formed by the stone shafts and mullions were blocked up, so that
      the apartment was very gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they stopped, and the mistress of the mansion, for such she was,
      embraced Magdalen Graeme, and greeting her by the title of sister, kissed
      her with much solemnity, on either side of the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blessing of Our Lady be upon you, my sister,&rdquo; were her next words;
      and they left no doubt upon Roland's mind respecting the religion of their
      hostess, even if he could have suspected his venerable and zealous guide
      of resting elsewhere than in the habitation of an orthodox Catholic. They
      spoke together a few words in private, during which he had leisure to
      remark more particularly the appearance of his grandmother's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her age might be betwixt fifty and sixty; her looks had a mixture of
      melancholy and unhappiness that bordered on discontent, and obscured the
      remains of beauty which age had still left on her features. Her dress was
      of the plainest and most ordinary description, of a dark colour, and, like
      Magdalen Graeme's, something approaching to a religious habit. Strict
      neatness and cleanliness of person, seemed to intimate, that if poor, she
      was not reduced to squalid or heart-broken distress, and that she was
      still sufficiently attached to life to retain a taste for its decencies,
      if not its elegancies. Her manner, as well as her features and appearance,
      argued an original condition and education far above the meanness of her
      present appearance. In short, the whole figure was such as to excite the
      idea, &ldquo;That female must have had a history worth knowing.&rdquo; While Roland
      Graeme was making this very reflection, the whispers of the two females
      ceased, and the mistress of the mansion, approaching him, looked on his
      face and person with much attention, and, as it seemed, some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then,&rdquo; she said, addressing his relative, &ldquo;is the child of thine
      unhappy daughter, sister Magdalen; and him, the only shoot from your
      ancient tree, you are willing to devote to the Good Cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by the rood,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme, in her usual tone of
      resolved determination, &ldquo;to the good cause I devote him, flesh and fell,
      sinew and limb, body and soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a happy woman, sister Magdalen,&rdquo; answered her companion, &ldquo;that,
      lifted so high above human affection and human feeling, thou canst bind
      such a victim to the horns of the altar. Had I been called to make such a
      sacrifice&mdash;to plunge a youth so young and fair into the plots and
      bloodthirsty dealings of the time, not the patriarch Abraham, when he led
      Isaac up the mountain, would have rendered more melancholy obedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then continued to look at Roland with a mournful aspect of compassion,
      until the intentness of her gaze occasioned his colour to rise, and he was
      about to move out of its influence, when he was stopped by his
      grand-mother with one hand, while with the other she divided the hair upon
      his forehead, which was now crimson with bashfulness, while she added,
      with a mixture of proud affection and firm resolution,&mdash;&ldquo;Ay, look at
      him well, my sister, for on a fairer face thine eye never rested. I too,
      when I first saw him, after a long separation, felt as the worldly feel,
      and was half shaken in my purpose. But no wind can tear a leaf from the
      withered tree which has long been stripped of its foliage, and no mere
      human casualty can awaken the mortal feelings which have long slept in the
      calm of devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the old woman thus spoke, her manner gave the lie to her assertions,
      for the tears rose to her eyes while she added, &ldquo;But the fairer and the
      more spotless the victim, is it not, my sister, the more worthy of
      acceptance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed glad to escape from the sensations which agitated her, and
      instantly added, &ldquo;He will escape, my sister&mdash;there will be a ram
      caught in the thicket, and the hand of our revolted brethren shall not be
      on the youthfull Joseph. Heaven can defend its own rights, even by means
      of babes and sucklings, of women and beardless boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven hath left us,&rdquo; said the other female; &ldquo;for our sins and our
      fathers' the succours of the blessed Saints have abandoned this accursed
      land. We may win the crown of Martyrdom, but not that of earthly triumph.
      One, too, whose prudence was at this deep crisis so indispensable, has
      been called to a better world. The Abbot Eustatius is no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May his soul have mercy!&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;and may Heaven, too,
      have mercy upon us, who linger behind in this bloody land! His loss is
      indeed a perilous blow to our enterprise; for who remains behind
      possessing his far-fetched experience, his self-devoted zeal, his
      consummate wisdom, and his undaunted courage! He hath fallen with the
      church's standard in his hand, but God will raise up another to lift the
      blessed banner. Whom have the Chapter elected in his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rumoured no one of the few remaining brethren dare accept the
      office. The heretics have sworn that they will permit no future election,
      and will heavily punish any attempt to create a new Abbot of Saint Mary's.
      <i>Conjuraverunt inter se principes, dicentes, Projiciamus laqueos ejus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quousque, Domine!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;ejaculated Magdalen; &ldquo;this, my sister,
      were indeed a perilous and fatal breach in our band; but I am firm in my
      belief, that another will arise in the place of him so untimely removed.
      Where is thy daughter Catharine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the parlour,&rdquo; answered the matron, &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;She looked at Roland
      Graeme, and muttered something in the ear of her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear it not,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;it is both lawful and necessary&mdash;fear
      nothing from him&mdash;I would he were as well grounded in the faith by
      which alone comes safety, as he is free from thought, deed, or speech of
      villany. Therein is the heretics' discipline to be commended, my sister,
      that they train up their youth in strong morality, and choke up every
      inlet to youthful folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but a cleansing the outside of the cup,&rdquo; answered her friend, &ldquo;a
      whitening of the sepulchre; but he shall see Catharine, since you, sister,
      judge it safe and meet.&mdash;Follow us, youth,&rdquo; she added, and led the
      way from the apartment&mdash;with her friend. These were the only words
      which the matron had addressed to Roland Graeme, who obeyed them in
      silence. As they paced through several winding passages and waste
      apartments with a very slow step, the young page had leisure to make some
      reflections on his situation,&mdash;reflections of a nature which his
      ardent temper considered as specially disagreeable. It seemed he had now
      got two mistresses, or tutoresses, instead of one, both elderly women, and
      both, it would seem, in league to direct his motions according to their
      own pleasure, and for the accomplishment of plans to which he was no
      party. This, he thought, was too much; arguing reasonably enough, that
      whatever right his grandmother and benefactress had to guide his motions,
      she was neither entitled to transfer her authority or divide it with
      another, who seemed to assume, without ceremony, the same tone of absolute
      command over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it shall not long continue thus,&rdquo; thought Roland; &ldquo;I will not be all
      my life the slave of a woman's whistle, to go when she bids, and come when
      she calls. No, by Saint Andrew! the hand that can hold the lance is above
      the control of the distaff. I will leave them the slipp'd collar in their
      hands on the first opportunity, and let them execute their own devices by
      their own proper force. It may save them both from peril, for I guess what
      they meditate is not likely to prove either safe or easy&mdash;the Earl of
      Murray and his heresy are too well rooted to be grubbed up by two old
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he thus resolved, they entered a low room, in which a third female was
      seated. This apartment was the first he had observed in the mansion which
      was furnished with moveable seats, and with a wooden table, over which was
      laid a piece of tapestry. A carpet was spread on the floor, there was a
      grate in the chimney, and, in brief, the apartment had the air of being
      habitable and inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roland's eyes found better employment than to make observations on the
      accommodations of the chamber; for this second female inhabitant of the
      mansion seemed something very different from any thing he had yet seen
      there. At his first entry, she had greeted with a silent and low obeisance
      the two aged matrons, then glancing her eyes towards Roland, she adjusted
      a veil which hung back over her shoulders, so as to bring it over her
      face; an operation which she performed with much modesty, but without
      either affected haste or embarrassed timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this manoeuvre Roland had time to observe, that the face was that
      of a girl apparently not much past sixteen, and that the eyes were at once
      soft and brilliant. To these very favourable observations was added the
      certainty that the fair object to whom they referred possessed an
      excellent shape, bordering perhaps on <i>enbonpoint</i>, and therefore
      rather that of a Hebe than of a Sylph, but beautifully formed, and shown
      to great advantage by the close jacket and petticoat which she wore after
      a foreign fashion, the last not quite long enough to conceal a very pretty
      foot, which rested on a bar of the table at which she sate; her round arms
      and taper fingers very busily employed in repairing&mdash;the piece of
      tapestry which was spread on it, which exhibited several deplorable
      fissures, enough to demand the utmost skill of the most expert seamstress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be remarked, that it was by stolen glances that Roland Graeme
      contrived to ascertain these interesting particulars; and he thought he
      could once or twice, notwithstanding the texture of the veil, detect the
      damsel in the act of taking similar cognizance of his own person. The
      matrons in the meanwhile continued their separate conversation, eyeing
      from time to time the young people, in a manner which left Roland in no
      doubt that they were the subject of their conversation. At length he
      distinctly heard Magdalen Graeme say these words&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, my sister, we
      must give them opportunity to speak together, and to become acquainted;
      they must be personally known to each other, or how shall they be able to
      execute what they are intrusted with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if the matron, not fully satisfied with her friend's
      reasoning, continued to offer some objections; but they were borne down by
      her more dictatorial friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my dear sister; let us therefore go forth on
      the balcony, to finish our conversation.&mdash;And do you,&rdquo; she said,
      addressing Roland and the girl, &ldquo;become acquainted with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this she stepped up to the young woman, and raising her veil,
      discovered features which, whatever might be their ordinary complexion,
      were now covered with a universal blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Licitum sit,</i>&rdquo; said Magdalen, looking at the other matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Vix licitum,</i>&rdquo; replied the other, with reluctant and hesitating
      acquiescence; and again adjusting the veil of the blushing girl, she
      dropped it so as to shade, though not to conceal her countenance, and
      whispered to her, in a tone loud enough for the page to hear, &ldquo;Remember,
      Catharine, who thou art, and for what destined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matron then retreated with Magdalen Graeme through one of the
      casements of the apartment, that opened on a large broad balcony, which,
      with its ponderous balustrade, had once run along the whole south front of
      the building which faced the brook, and formed a pleasant and commodious
      walk in the open air. It was now in some places deprived of the
      balustrade, in others broken and narrowed; but, ruinous as it was, could
      still be used as a pleasant promenade. Here then walked the two ancient
      dames, busied in their private conversation; yet not so much so, but that
      Roland could observe the matrons, as their thin forms darkened the
      casement in passing or repassing before it, dart a glance into the
      apartment, to see how matters were going on there.

      Chapter the Eleventh.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Life hath its May, and is mirthful then:
  The woods are vocal, and the flowers all odour;
  Its very blast has mirth in't,&mdash;and the maidens,
  The while they don their cloaks to screen their kirtles,
  Laugh at the rain that wets them.
                             OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Catherine was at the happy age of innocence and buoyancy of spirit, when,
      after the first moment of embarrassment was over, a situation of
      awkwardness, like that in which she was suddenly left to make acquaintance
      with a handsome youth, not even known to her by name, struck her, in spite
      of herself, in a ludicrous point of view. She bent her beautiful eyes upon
      the work with which she was busied, and with infinite gravity sate out the
      two first turns of the matrons upon the balcony; but then, glancing her
      deep blue eye a little towards Roland, and observing the embarrassment
      under which he laboured, now shifting on his chair, and now dangling his
      cap, the whole man evincing that he was perfectly at a loss how to open
      the conversation, she could keep her composure no longer, but after a vain
      struggle broke out into a sincere, though a very involuntary fit of
      laughing, so richly accompanied by the laughter of her merry eyes, which
      actually glanced through the tears which the effort filled them with, and
      by the waving of her rich tresses, that the goddess of smiles herself
      never looked more lovely than Catherine at that moment. A court page would
      not have left her long alone in her mirth; but Roland was country-bred,
      and, besides, having some jealousy as well as bashfulness, he took it into
      his head that he was himself the object of her inextinguishable laughter.
      His endeavours to sympathize with Catherine, therefore, could carry him no
      farther than a forced giggle, which had more of displeasure than of mirth
      in it, and which so much enhanced that of the girl, that it seemed to
      render it impossible for her ever to bring her laughter to an end, with
      whatever anxious pains she laboured to do so. For every one has felt, that
      when a paroxysm of laughter has seized him at a misbecoming time and
      place, the efforts which he made to suppress it, nay, the very sense of
      the impropriety of giving way to it, tend only to augment and prolong the
      irresistible impulse.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0169}.jpg" alt="{0169}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0169}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      It was undoubtedly lucky for Catherine, as well as for Roland, that the
      latter did not share in the excessive mirth of the former. For, seated as
      she was, with her back to the casement, Catherine could easily escape the
      observation of the two matrons during the course of their promenade;
      whereas Graeme was so placed, with his side to the window, that his mirth,
      had he shared that of his companion, would have been instantly visible,
      and could not have failed to give offence to the personages in question.
      He sate, however, with some impatience, until Catherine had exhausted
      either her power or her desire of laughing, and was returning with good
      grace to the exercise of her needle, and then he observed with some
      dryness, that &ldquo;there seemed no great occasion to recommend to them to
      improve their acquaintance, as it seemed, that they were already tolerably
      familiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine had an extreme desire to set off upon a fresh score, but she
      repressed it strongly, and fixing her eyes on her work, replied by asking
      his pardon, and promising to avoid future offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland had sense enough to feel, that an air of offended dignity was very
      much misplaced, and that it was with a very different bearing he ought to
      meet the deep blue eyes which had borne such a hearty burden in the
      laughing scene. He tried, therefore, to extricate himself as well as he
      could from his blunder, by assuming a tone of correspondent gaiety, and
      requesting to know of the nymph, &ldquo;how it was her pleasure that they should
      proceed in improving the acquaintance which had commenced so merrily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must yourself discover; perhaps I have gone a step
      too far in opening our interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;we should begin as in a tale-book, by
      asking each other's names and histories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is right well imagined,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;and shows an argute
      judgment. Do you begin, and I will listen, and only put in a question or
      two at the dark parts of the story. Come, unfold then your name and
      history, my new acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am called Roland Graeme, and that tall woman is my grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your tutoress?&mdash;good. Who are your parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are both dead,&rdquo; replied Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but who were they? you <i>had</i> parents, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;but I have never been able to learn much of
      their history. My father was a Scottish knight, who died gallantly in his
      stirrups&mdash;my mother was a Graeme of Hathergill, in the Debateable
      Land&mdash;most of her family were killed when the Debateable country was
      burned by Lord Maxwell and Herries of Caerlaverock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it long ago?&rdquo; said the damsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I was born,&rdquo; answered the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a great while since,&rdquo; said she, shaking her head gravely;
      &ldquo;look you, I cannot weep for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needs not,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;they fell with honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for your lineage, fair sir,&rdquo; replied his companion, &ldquo;of whom I
      like the living specimen (a glance at the casement) far less than those
      that are dead. Your much honoured grandmother looks as if she could make
      one weep in sad earnest. And now, fair sir, for your own person&mdash;if
      you tell not the tale faster, it will be cut short in the middle; Mother
      Bridget pauses longer and longer every time she passes the window, and
      with her there is as little mirth as in the grave of your ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tale is soon told&mdash;I was introduced into the castle of Avenel to
      be page to the lady of the mansion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a strict Huguenot, is she not?&rdquo; said the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As strict as Calvin himself. But my grandmother can play the puritan when
      it suits her purpose, and she had some plan of her own, for quartering me
      in the Castle&mdash;it would have failed, however, after we had remained
      several weeks at the hamlet, but for an unexpected master of ceremonies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was that?&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large black dog, Wolf by name, who brought me into the castle one day
      in his mouth, like a hurt wild-duck, and presented me to the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most respectable introduction, truly,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;and what might
      you learn at this same castle? I love dearly to know what my acquaintances
      can do at need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fly a hawk, hollow to a hound, back a horse, and wield lance, bow, and
      brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to boast of all this when you have learned it,&rdquo; said Catherine,
      &ldquo;which, in France at least, is the surest accomplishment of a page. But
      proceed, fair sir; how came your Huguenot lord and your no less Huguenot
      lady to receive and keep in the family so perilous a person as a Catholic
      page?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they knew not that part of my history, which from infancy I have
      been taught to keep secret&mdash;and because my grand-dame's former
      zealous attendance on their heretic chaplain, had laid all this suspicion
      to sleep, most fair Callipolis,&rdquo; said the page; and in so saying, he edged
      his chair towards the seat of the fair querist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but keep your distance, most gallant sir,&rdquo; answered the blue-eyed
      maiden, &ldquo;for, unless I greatly mistake, these reverend ladies will soon
      interrupt our amicable conference, if the acquaintance they recommend
      shall seem to proceed beyond a certain point&mdash;so, fair sir, be
      pleased to abide by your station, and reply to my questions.&mdash;By what
      achievements did you prove the qualities of a page, which you had thus
      happily acquired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland, who began to enter into the tone and spirit of the damsel's
      conversation, replied to her with becoming spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In no feat, fair gentlewoman, was I found inexpert, wherein there was
      mischief implied. I shot swans, hunted cats, frightened serving-women,
      chased the deer, and robbed the orchard. I say nothing of tormenting the
      chaplain in various ways, for that was my duty as a good Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, as I am a gentlewoman,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;I think these heretics have
      done Catholic penance in entertaining so all-accomplished a serving-man!
      And what, fair sir, might have been the unhappy event which deprived them
      of an inmate altogether so estimable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, fair gentlewoman,&rdquo; answered the youth, &ldquo;your real proverb says
      that the longest lane will have a turning, and mine was more&mdash;it was,
      in fine, a turning off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the merry young maiden, &ldquo;it is an apt play on the word&mdash;and
      what occasion was taken for so important a catastrophe?&mdash;Nay, start
      not for my learning, I do know the schools&mdash;in plain phrase, why were
      you sent from service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page shrugged his shoulders while he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;A short tale is
      soon told&mdash;and a short horse soon curried. I made the falconer's boy
      taste of my switch&mdash;the falconer threatened to make me brook his
      cudgel&mdash;he is a kindly clown as well as a stout, and I would rather
      have been cudgelled by him than any man in Christendom to choose&mdash;but
      I knew not his qualities at that time&mdash;so I threatened to make him
      brook the stab, and my Lady made me brook the 'Begone;' so adieu to the
      page's office and the fair Castle of Avenel&mdash;I had not travelled far
      before I met my venerable parent&mdash;And so tell your tale, fair
      gentlewoman, for mine is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A happy grandmother,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;who had the luck to find the
      stray page just when his mistress had slipped his leash, and a most lucky
      page that has jumped at once from a page to an old lady's
      gentleman-usher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is nothing of your history,&rdquo; answered Roland Graeme, began to be
      much interested in the congenial vivacity of this facetious young
      gentlewoman,&mdash;&ldquo;tale for tale is fellow-traveller's justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till we are fellow-travellers, then,&rdquo; replied Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you escape me not so,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;if you deal not justly by me,
      I will call out to Dame Bridget, or whatever your dame be called, and
      proclaim you for a cheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not need,&rdquo; answered the maiden&mdash;&ldquo;my history is the
      counterpart of your own; the same words might almost serve, change but
      dress and name. I am called Catherine Seyton, and I also am an orphan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your parents been long dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the only question,&rdquo; said she, throwing down her fine eyes with a
      sudden expression of sorrow, &ldquo;that is the only question I cannot laugh
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dame Bridget is your grandmother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden cloud passed away like that which crosses for an instant the
      summer sun, and she answered with her usual lively expression, &ldquo;Worse by
      twenty degrees&mdash;Dame Bridget is my maiden aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over gods forbode!&rdquo; said Roland&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! that you have such a tale to
      tell! and what horror comes next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own history, exactly. I was taken upon trial for service&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And turned off for pinching the duenna, or affronting my lady's
      waiting-woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, our history varies there,&rdquo; said the damsel&mdash;&ldquo;Our mistress broke
      up house, or had her house broke up, which is the same thing, and I am a
      free woman of the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am as glad of it as if any one had lined my doublet with cloth of
      gold,&rdquo; said the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your mirth,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but the matter is not likely to
      concern you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but go on,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;for you will be presently interrupted;
      the two good dames have been soaring yonder on the balcony, like two old
      hooded crows, and their croak grows hoarser as night comes on; they will
      wing to roost presently.&mdash;This mistress of yours, fair gentlewoman,
      who was she, in God's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she has a fair name in the world,&rdquo; replied Catherine Seyton. &ldquo;Few
      ladies kept a fairer house, or held more gentlewomen in her household; my
      aunt Bridget was one of her housekeepers. We never saw our mistress's
      blessed face, to be sure, but we heard enough of her; were up early and
      down late, and were kept to long prayers and light food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out upon the penurious old beldam!&rdquo; said the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, blaspheme not!&rdquo; said the girl, with an expression of
      fear.&mdash;&ldquo;God pardon us both! I meant no harm. I speak of our blessed
      Saint Catherine of Sienna!&mdash;may God forgive me that I spoke so
      lightly, and made you do a great sin and a great blasphemy. This was her
      nunnery, in which there were twelve nuns and an abbess. My aunt was the
      abbess, till the heretics turned all adrift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are your companions?&rdquo; asked the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the last year's snow,&rdquo; answered the maiden; &ldquo;east, north, south, and
      west&mdash;some to France, some to Flanders, some, I fear, into the world
      and its pleasures. We have got permission to remain, or rather our
      remaining has been connived at, for my aunt has great relations among the
      Kerrs, and they have threatened a death-feud if any one touches us; and
      bow and spear are the best warrant in these times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, you sit under a sure shadow,&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;and I suppose
      you wept yourself blind when Saint Catherine broke up housekeeping before
      you had taken arles [Footnote: <i>Anglice</i>&mdash;Earnest-money] in her
      service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! for Heaven's sake,&rdquo; said the damsel, crossing herself; &ldquo;no more of
      that! but I have not quite cried my eyes out,&rdquo; said she, turning them upon
      him, and instantly again bending them upon her work. It was one of those
      glances which would require the threefold plate of brass around the heart,
      more than it is needed by the mariners, to whom Horace recommends it. Our
      youthful page had no defence whatever to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you, Catherine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we two, thus strangely turned out
      of service at the same time, should give our two most venerable duennas
      the torch to hold, while we walk a merry measure with each other over the
      floor of this weary world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A goodly proposal, truly,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;and worthy the mad-cap brain
      of a discarded page!&mdash;And what shifts does your worship propose we
      should live by?&mdash;by singing ballads, cutting purses, or swaggering on
      the highway? for there, I think, you would find your most productive
      exchequer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choose, you proud peat!&rdquo; said the page, drawing off in huge disdain at
      the calm and unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild proposal was
      received. And as he spoke the words, the casement was again darkened by
      the forms of the matrons&mdash;it opened, and admitted Magdalen Graeme and
      the Mother Abbess, so we must now style her, into the apartment.

    <h2>
      Chapter the Twelfth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Nay, hear me, brother&mdash;I am elder, wiser,
  And holier than thou&mdash;And age, and wisdom,
  And holiness, have peremptory claims,
  And will be listen'd to.
                              OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the matrons re-entered, and put an end to the conversation&mdash;which
      we have detailed in the last chapter, Dame Magdalen Graeme thus addressed
      her grandson and his pretty companion: &ldquo;Have you spoke together, my
      children?&mdash;Have you become known to each other as fellow-travellers
      on the same dark and dubious road, whom chance hath brought together, and
      who study to learn the tempers and dispositions of those by whom their
      perils are to be shared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was seldom the light-hearted Catharine could suppress a jest, so that
      she often spoke when she would have acted more wisely in holding her
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandson admires the journey which you propose so very greatly, that
      he was even now preparing for setting out upon it instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to be too forward, Roland,&rdquo; said the dame, addressing him, &ldquo;as
      yesterday you were over slack&mdash;the just mean lies in obedience, which
      both waits for the signal to start, and obeys it when given.&mdash;But
      once again, my children, have you so perused each other's countenances,
      that when you meet, in whatever disguise the times may impose upon you,
      you may recognize each in the other the secret agent of the mighty work in
      which you are to be leagued?&mdash;Look at each other, know each line and
      lineament of each other's countenance. Learn to distinguish by the step,
      by the sound of the voice, by the motion of the hand, by the glance of the
      eye, the partner whom Heaven hath sent to aid in working its will.&mdash;Wilt
      thou know that maiden, whensoever, or wheresoever you shall again meet
      her, my Roland Graeme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As readily as truly did Roland answer in the affirmative. &ldquo;And thou, my
      daughter, wilt thou again remember the features of this youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, mother,&rdquo; replied Catherine Seyton, &ldquo;I have not seen so many men of
      late, that I should immediately forget your grandson, though I mark not
      much about him that is deserving of especial remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join hands, then, my children,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme; but, in saying so,
      was interrupted by her companion, whose conventual prejudices had been
      gradually giving her more and more uneasiness, and who could remain
      acquiescent no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my good sister, you forget,&rdquo; said she to Magdalen, &ldquo;Catharine is the
      betrothed bride of Heaven&mdash;these intimacies cannot be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in the cause of Heaven that I command them to embrace,&rdquo; said
      Magdalen, with the full force of her powerful voice; &ldquo;the end, sister,
      sanctifies the means we must use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call me Lady Abbess, or Mother at the least, who address me,&rdquo; said
      Dame Bridget, drawing herself up, as if offended at her friend's
      authoritative manner&mdash;&ldquo;the Lady of Heathergill forgets that she
      speaks to the Abbess of Saint Catherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was what you call me,&rdquo; said Magdalen, &ldquo;you indeed were the Abbess
      of Saint Catherine, but both names are now gone, with all the rank that
      the world and that the church gave to them; and we are now, to the eye of
      human judgment, two poor, despised, oppressed women, dragging our
      dishonoured old age to a humble grave. But what are we in the eye of
      Heaven?&mdash;Ministers, sent forth to work his will,&mdash;in whose
      weakness the strength of the church shall be manifested-before whom shall
      be humbled the wisdom of Murray, and the dark strength of Morton,&mdash;And
      to such wouldst thou apply the narrow rules of thy cloistered seclusion?&mdash;or,
      hast thou forgotten the order which I showed thee from thy Superior,
      subjecting thee to me in these matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On thy head, then, be the scandal and the sin,&rdquo; said the Abbess,
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On mine be they both,&rdquo; said Magdalen. &ldquo;I say, embrace each other, my
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Catherine, aware, perhaps, how the dispute was likely to terminate,
      had escaped from the apartment, and so disappointed the grandson, at least
      as much as the old matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone,&rdquo; said the Abbess, &ldquo;to provide some little refreshment. But
      it will have little savour to those who dwell in the world; for I, at
      least, cannot dispense with the rules to which I am vowed, because it is
      the will of wicked men to break down the sanctuary in which they wont to
      be observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, my sister,&rdquo; replied Magdalen, &ldquo;to pay each even the smallest
      tithes of mint and cummin which the church demands, and I blame not thy
      scrupulous observance of the rules of thine order. But they were
      established by the church, and for the church's benefit; and reason it is
      that they should give way when the salvation of the church herself is at
      stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbess made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more acquainted with human nature than the inexperienced page, might
      have found amusement in comparing the different kinds of fanaticisms which
      these two females exhibited. The Abbess, timid, narrowminded, and
      discontented, clung to ancient usages and pretensions which were ended by
      the Reformation; and was in adversity, as she had been in prosperity,
      scrupulous, weak-spirited, and bigoted. While the fiery and more lofty
      spirit of her companion suggested a wider field of effort, and would not
      be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary schemes which were
      suggested by her bold and irregular imagination. But Roland Graeme,
      instead of tracing these peculiarities of character in the two old damps,
      only waited with great anxiety for the return of Catherine, expecting
      probably that the proposal of the fraternal embrace would be renewed, as
      his grandmother seemed disposed to carry matters with a high hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His expectations, or hopes, if we may call them so, were, however,
      disappointed; for, when Catherine re-entered on the summons of the Abbess,
      and placed on the table an earthen pitcher of water, and four wooden
      platters, with cups of the same materials, the Dame of Heathergill,
      satisfied with the arbitrary mode in which she had borne down the
      opposition of the Abbess, pursued her victory no farther&mdash;a
      moderation for which her grandson, in his heart, returned her but slender
      thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Catherine continued to place upon the table the slender
      preparations for the meal of a recluse, which consisted almost entirely of
      colewort, boiled and served up in a wooden platter, having no better
      seasoning than a little salt, and no better accompaniment than some coarse
      barley-bread, in very moderate quantity. The water-pitcher, already
      mentioned, furnished the only beverage. After a Latin grace, delivered by
      the Abbess, the guests sat down to their spare entertainment. The
      simplicity of the fare appeared to produce no distaste in the females, who
      ate of it moderately, but with the usual appearance of appetite. But
      Roland Graeme had been used to better cheer. Sir Halbert Glendinning, who
      affected even an unusual degree of nobleness in his housekeeping,
      maintained it in a style of genial hospitality, which rivalled that of the
      Northern Barons of England. He might think, perhaps, that by doing so, he
      acted yet more completely the part for which he was born&mdash;that of a
      great Baron and a leader. Two bullocks, and six sheep, weekly, were the
      allowance when the Baron was at home, and the number was not greatly
      diminished during his absence. A boll of malt was weekly brewed into ale,
      which was used by the household at discretion. Bread was baked in
      proportion for the consumption of his domestics and retainers; and in this
      scene of plenty had Roland Graeme now lived for several years. It formed a
      bad introduction to lukewarm greens and spring-water; and probably his
      countenance indicated some sense of the difference, for the Abbess
      observed, &ldquo;It would seem, my son, that the tables of the heretic Baron,
      whom you have so long followed, are more daintily furnished than those of
      the suffering daughters of the church; and yet, not upon the most solemn
      nights of festival, when the nuns were permitted to eat their portion at
      mine own table, did I consider the cates, which were then served up, as
      half so delicious as these vegetables and this water, on which I prefer to
      feed, rather than do aught which may derogate from the strictness of my
      vow. It shall never be said that the mistress of this house made it a
      house of feasting, when days of darkness and of affliction were hanging
      over the Holy Church, of which I am an unworthy member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well hast thou said, my sister,&rdquo; replied Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;but now it is
      not only time to suffer in the good cause, but to act in it. And since our
      pilgrim's meal is finished, let us go apart to prepare for our journey
      tomorrow, and to advise on the manner in which these children shall be
      employed, and what measures we can adopt to supply their thoughtlessness
      and lack of discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his indifferent cheer, the heart of Roland Graeme bounded
      high at this proposal, which he doubted not would lead to another <i>tête-â-tête</i>
      betwixt him and the pretty novice. But he was mistaken. Catherine, it
      would seem, had no mind so far to indulge him; for, moved either by
      delicacy or caprice, or some of those indescribable shades betwixt the one
      and the other, with which women love to tease, and at the same time to
      captivate, the ruder sex, she reminded the Abbess that it was necessary
      she should retire an hour before vespers; and, receiving the ready and
      approving nod of her Superior, she arose to withdraw. But before leaving
      the apartment, she made obeisance to the matrons, bending herself till her
      hands touched her knees, and then made a lesser reverence to Roland, which
      consisted in a slight bend of the body and gentle depression of the head.
      This she performed very demurely; but the party on whom the salutation was
      conferred, thought he could discern in her manner an arch and mischievous
      exultation over his secret disappointment.&mdash;&ldquo;The devil take the saucy
      girl,&rdquo; he thought in his heart, though the presence of the Abbess should
      have repressed all such profane imaginations,&mdash;&ldquo;she is as
      hard-hearted as the laughing hyaena that the story-books tell of&mdash;she
      has a mind that I shall not forget her this night at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matrons now retired also, giving the page to understand that he was on
      no account to stir from the convent, or to show himself at the windows,
      the Abbess assigning as a reason, the readiness with which the rude
      heretics caught at every occasion of scandalizing the religious orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is worse than the rigour of Mr. Henry Warden, himself,&rdquo; said the
      page, when he was left alone; &ldquo;for, to do him justice, however strict in
      requiring the most rigid attention during the time of his homilies, he
      left us to the freedom of our own wills afterwards&mdash;ay, and would
      take a share in our pastimes, too, if he thought them entirely innocent.
      But these old women are utterly wrapt up in gloom, mystery and
      self-denial.&mdash;Well, then, if I must neither stir out of the gate nor
      look out at window, I will at least see what the inside of the house
      contains that may help to pass away one's time&mdash;peradventure I may
      light on that blue-eyed laugher in some corner or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going, therefore, out of the chamber by the entrance opposite to that
      through which the two matrons had departed, (for it may be readily
      supposed that he had no desire to intrude on their privacy.) he wandered
      from one chamber to another, through the deserted edifice, seeking, with
      boyish eagerness, some source of interest and amusement. Here he passed
      through a long gallery, opening on either hand into the little cells of
      the nuns, all deserted, and deprived of the few trifling articles of
      furniture which the rules of the order admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birds are flown,&rdquo; thought the page; &ldquo;but whether they will find
      themselves worse off in the open air than in these damp narrow cages, I
      leave my Lady Abbess and my venerable relative to settle betwixt them. I
      think the wild young lark whom they have left behind them, would like best
      to sing under God's free sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A winding stair, strait and narrow, as if to remind the nuns of their
      duties of fast and maceration, led down to a lower suite of apartments,
      which occupied the ground story of the house. These rooms were even more
      ruinous than those which he had left; for, having encountered the first
      fury of the assailants by whom the nunnery had been wasted, the windows
      had been dashed in, the doors broken down, and even the partitions betwixt
      the apartments, in some places, destroyed. As he thus stalked from
      desolation to desolation, and began to think of returning from so
      uninteresting a research to the chamber which he had left, he was
      surprised to hear the low of a cow very close to him. The sound was so
      unexpected at the time and place, that Roland Graeme started as if it had
      been the voice of a lion, and laid his hand on his dagger, while at the
      same moment the light and lovely form of Catherine Seyton presented itself
      at the door of the apartment from which the sound had issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good even to you, valiant champion!&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;since the days of Guy of
      Warwick, never was one more worthy to encounter a dun cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cow?&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;by my faith, I thought it had been the devil
      that roared so near me. Who ever heard of a convent containing a
      cow-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cow and calf may come hither now,&rdquo; answered Catherine, &ldquo;for we have no
      means to keep out either. But I advise you, kind sir, to return to the
      place from whence you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till I see your charge, fair sister,&rdquo; answered Roland, and made his
      way into the apartment, in spite of the half serious half laughing
      remonstrances of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor solitary cow, now the only severe recluse within the nunnery, was
      quartered in a spacious chamber, which had once been the refectory of the
      convent. The roof was graced with groined arches, and the wall with
      niches, from which the images had been pulled down. These remnants of
      architectural ornaments were strangely contrasted with the rude crib
      constructed for the cow in one corner of the apartment, and the stack of
      fodder which was piled beside it for her food. [Footnote: This, like the
      cell of Saint Cuthbert, is an imaginary scene, but I took one or two ideas
      of the desolation of the interior from a story told me by my father. In
      his youth&mdash;it may be near eighty years since, as he was born in 1729&mdash;he
      had occasion to visit an old lady who resided in a Border castle of
      considerable renown. Only one very limited portion of the extensive ruins
      sufficed for the accommodation of the inmates, and my father amused
      himself by wandering through the part that was untenanted. In a
      dining-apartment, having a roof richly adorned with arches and drops,
      there was deposited a large stack of hay, to which calves were helping
      themselves from opposite sides. As my father was scaling a dark ruinous
      turnpike staircase, his greyhound ran up before him, and probably was the
      means of saving his life, for the animal fell through a trap-door, or
      aperture in the stair, thus warning the owner of the danger of the ascent.
      As the dog continued howling from a great depth, my father got the old
      butler, who alone knew most of the localities about the castle, to unlock
      a sort of stable, in which Kill-buck was found safe and sound, the place
      being filled with the same commodity which littered the stalls of Augeas,
      and which had rendered the dog's fall an easy one.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;Crombie is more lordly lodged than any one
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best remain with her,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;and supply by your filial
      attentions the offspring she has had the ill luck to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remain, at least, to help you to prepare her night's lair, pretty
      Catherine,&rdquo; said Roland, seizing upon a pitch-fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;for, besides that you know not in the
      least how to do her that service, you will bring a chiding my way, and I
      get enough of that in the regular course of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! for accepting my assistance?&rdquo; said the page,&mdash;&ldquo;for accepting
      <i>my</i> assistance, who am to be your confederate in some deep matter of
      import? That were altogether unreasonable&mdash;and, now I think on it,
      tell me if you can, what is this mighty emprise to which I am destined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbing a bird's nest, I should suppose,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;considering
      the champion whom they have selected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and he that has taken a falcon's nest in
      the Scaurs of Polmoodie, has done something to brag of, my fair sister.&mdash;But
      that is all over now&mdash;a murrain on the nest, and the eyases and their
      food, washed or unwashed, for it was all anon of cramming these worthless
      kites that I was sent upon my present travels. Save that I have met with
      you, pretty sister, I could eat my dagger-hilt for vexation at my own
      folly. But, as we are to be fellow-travellers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-labourers! not fellow-travellers!&rdquo; answered the girl; &ldquo;for to your
      comfort be it known, that the Lady Abbess and I set out earlier than you
      and your respected relative to-morrow, and that I partly endure your
      company at present, because it may be long ere we meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Andrew, but it shall not though,&rdquo; answered Roland; &ldquo;I will not
      hunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect, in that and in other points, we must do as we are bid,&rdquo;
       replied the young lady.&mdash;&ldquo;But, hark! I hear my aunt's voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady entered in good earnest, and darted a severe glance at her
      niece, while Roland had the ready wit to busy himself about the halter of
      the cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young gentleman,&rdquo; said Catherine, gravely, &ldquo;is helping me to tie the
      cow up faster to her stake, for I find that last night when she put her
      head out of window and lowed, she alarmed the whole village; and&mdash;we
      shall be suspected of sorcery among the heretics, if they do not discover
      the cause of the apparition, or lose our cow if they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relieve yourself of that fear,&rdquo; said the Abbess, somewhat ironically;
      &ldquo;the person to whom she is now sold, comes for the animal presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, then, my poor companion,&rdquo; said Catherine, patting the
      animal's shoulders; &ldquo;I hope thou hast fallen into kind hands, for my
      happiest hours of late have been spent in tending thee&mdash;I would I had
      been born to no better task!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, out upon thee, mean-spirited wench!&rdquo; said the Abbess; &ldquo;is that a
      speech worthy of the name of Seyton, or of the mouth of a sister of this
      house, treading the path of election&mdash;and to be spoken before a
      stranger youth, too?&mdash;Go to my oratory, minion&mdash;there read your
      Hours till I come thither, when I will read you such a lecture as shall
      make you prize the blessings which you possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was about to withdraw in silence, casting a half sorrowful half
      comic glance at Roland Graeme, which seemed to say&mdash;&ldquo;You see to what
      your untimely visit has exposed me,&rdquo; when, suddenly changing her mind, she
      came forward to the page, and extended her hand as she bid him good
      evening. Their palms had pressed each other ere the astonished matron
      could interfere, and Catherine had time to say&mdash;&ldquo;Forgive me, mother;
      it is long since we have seen a face that looked with kindness on us.
      Since these disorders have broken up our peaceful retreat, all has been
      gloom and malignity. I bid this youth kindly farewell, because he has come
      hither in kindness, and because the odds are great, that we may never
      again meet in this world. I guess better than he, that the schemes on
      which you are rushing are too mighty for your management, and that you are
      now setting the stone a-rolling, which must surely crush you in its
      descent. I bid fare-well,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to my fellow-victim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken with a tone of deep and serious feeling, altogether
      different from the usual levity of Catherine's manner, and plainly showed,
      that beneath the giddiness of extreme youth and total inexperience, there
      lurked in her bosom a deeper power of sense and feeling, than her conduct
      had hitherto expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbess remained a moment silent after she had left the room. The
      proposed rebuke died on her tongue, and she appeared struck with the deep
      and foreboding, tone in which her niece had spoken her good-even. She led
      the way in silence to the apartment which they had formerly occupied, and
      where there was prepared a small refection, as the Abbess termed it,
      consisting of milk and barley-bread. Magdalen Graeme, summoned to take
      share in this collation, appeared from an adjoining apartment, but
      Catherine was seen no more. There was little said during the hasty meal,
      and after it was finished, Roland Graeme was dismissed to the nearest
      cell, where some preparations had been made for his repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange circumstances in which he found himself, had their usual
      effect in preventing slumber from hastily descending on him, and he could
      distinctly hear, by a low but earnest murmuring in the apartment which he
      had left, that the matrons continued in deep consultation to a late hour.
      As they separated he heard the Abbess distinctly express herself thus: &ldquo;In
      a word, my sister, I venerate your character and the authority with which
      my Superiors have invested you; yet it seems to me, that, ere entering on
      this perilous course, we should consult some of the Fathers of the
      Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how and where are we to find a faithful Bishop or Abbot at whom to
      ask counsel? The faithful Eustatius is no more&mdash;he is withdrawn from
      a world of evil, and from the tyranny of heretics. May Heaven and our Lady
      assoilzie him of his sins, and abridge the penance of his mortal
      infirmities!&mdash;Where shall we find another, with whom to take
      counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven will provide for the Church,&rdquo; said the Abbess; &ldquo;and the faithful
      fathers who yet are suffered to remain in the house of Kennaquhair, will
      proceed to elect an Abbot. They will not suffer the staff to fall down, or
      the mitre to be unfilled, for the threats of heresy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I learn to-morrow,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;yet who now takes
      the office of an hour, save to partake with the spoilers in their work of
      plunder?&mdash;to-morrow will tell us if one of the thousand saints who
      are sprung from the House of Saint Mary's continues to look down on it in
      its misery.&mdash;Farewell, my sister&mdash;we meet at Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benedicito!&rdquo; answered the Abbess, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Kennaquhair and to Edinburgh we bend our way.&rdquo; thought Roland Graeme.
      &ldquo;That information have I purchased by a sleepless hour&mdash;it suits well
      with my purpose. At Kennaquhair I shall see Father Ambrose;&mdash;at
      Edinburgh I shall find the means of shaping my own course through this
      bustling world, without burdening my affectionate relation&mdash;at
      Edinburgh, too, I shall see again the witching novice, with her blue eyes
      and her provoking smile.&rdquo;&mdash;He fell asleep, and it was to dream of
      Catherine Seyton.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  What, Dagon up again!&mdash;I thought we had hurl'd him
  Down on the threshold, never more to rise.
  Bring wedge and axe; and, neighbours, lend your hands
  And rive the idol into winter fagots!
                   ATHELSTANE, OR THE CONVERTED DANE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme slept long and sound, and the sun was high over the horizon,
      when the voice of his companion summoned him to resume their pilgrimage;
      and when, hastily arranging his dress, he went to attend her call, the
      enthusiastic matron stood already at the threshold, prepared for her
      journey. There was in all the deportment of this remarkable woman, a
      promptitude of execution, and a sternness of perseverance, founded on the
      fanaticism which she nursed so deeply, and which seemed to absorb all the
      ordinary purposes and feelings of mortality. One only human affection
      gleamed through her enthusiastic energies, like the broken glimpses of the
      sun through the rising clouds of a storm. It was her maternal fondness for
      her grandson&mdash;a fondness carried almost to the verge of dotage, in
      circumstances where the Catholic religion was not concerned, but which
      gave way instantly when it chanced either to thwart or come in contact
      with the more settled purpose of her soul, and the more devoted duty of
      her life. Her life she would willingly have laid down to save the earthly
      object of her affection; but that object itself she was ready to hazard,
      and would have been willing to sacrifice, could the restoration of the
      Church of Rome have been purchased with his blood. Her discourse by the
      way, excepting on the few occasions in which her extreme love of her
      grandson found opportunity to display itself in anxiety for his health and
      accommodation, turned entirely on the duty of raising up the fallen
      honours of the Church, and replacing a Catholic sovereign on the throne.
      There were times at which she hinted, though very obscurely and distantly,
      that she herself was foredoomed by Heaven to perform a part in this
      important task; and that she had more than mere human warranty for the
      zeal with which she engaged in it. But on this subject she expressed
      herself in such general language, that it was not easy to decide whether
      she made any actual pretensions to a direct and supernatural call, like
      the celebrated Elizabeth Barton, commonly called the Nun of Kent;
      [Footnote: A fanatic nun, called the Holy Maid of Kent, who pretended to
      the gift of prophecy and power of miracles. Having denounced the doom of
      speedy death against Henry VIII. for his marriage with Anne Boleyn, the
      prophetess was attainted in Parliament, and executed with her accomplices.
      Her imposture was for a time so successful, that even Sir Thomas More was
      disposed to be a believer.] or whether she dwelt upon the general duty
      which was incumbent on all Catholics of the time, and the pressure of
      which she felt in an extraordinary degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though Magdalen Graeme gave no direct intimation of her pretensions to
      be considered as something beyond the ordinary class of mortals, the
      demeanour of one or two persons amongst the travellers whom they
      occasionally met, as they entered the more fertile and populous part of
      the valley, seemed to indicate their belief in her superior attributes. It
      is true, that two clowns, who drove before them a herd of cattle&mdash;one
      or two village wenches, who seemed bound for some merry-making&mdash;a
      strolling soldier, in a rusted morion, and a wandering student, as his
      threadbare black cloak and his satchel of books proclaimed him&mdash;passed
      our travellers without observation, or with a look of contempt; and,
      moreover, that two or three children, attracted by the appearance of a
      dress so nearly resembling that of a pilgrim, joined in hooting and
      calling &ldquo;Out upon the mass-monger!&rdquo; But one or two, who nourished in their
      bosoms respect for the downfallen hierarchy&mdash;casting first a timorous
      glance around, to see that no one observed them&mdash;hastily crossed
      themselves&mdash;bent their knee to Sister Magdalen, by which name they
      saluted her&mdash;kissed her hand, or even the hem of her dalmatique&mdash;received
      with humility the Benedicite with which she repaid their obeisance; and
      then starting up, and again looking timidly round to see that they had
      been unobserved, hastily resumed their journey. Even while within sight of
      persons of the prevailing faith, there were individuals bold enough, by
      folding their arms and bending their head, to give distant and silent
      intimation that they recognized Sister Magdalen, and honoured alike her
      person and her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She failed not to notice to her grandson these marks of honour and respect
      which from time to time she received. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my son, that
      the enemies have been unable altogether to suppress the good spirit, or to
      root out the true seed. Amid heretics and schismatics, spoilers of the
      church's lands, and scoffers at saints and sacraments, there is left a
      remnant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, my mother,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;but methinks they are of a
      quality which can help us but little. See you not all those who wear steel
      at their side, and bear marks of better quality, ruffle past us as they
      would past the meanest beggars? for those who give us any marks of
      sympathy, are the poorest of the poor, and most outcast of the needy, who
      have neither bread to share with us, nor swords to defend us, nor skill to
      use them if they had. That poor wretch that last kneeled to you with such
      deep devotion, and who seemed emaciated by the touch of some wasting
      disease within, and the grasp of poverty without&mdash;that pale,
      shivering, miserable caitiff, how can he aid the great schemes you
      meditate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much, my son,&rdquo; said the Matron, with more mildness than the page perhaps
      expected. &ldquo;When that pious son of the church returns from the shrine of
      Saint Ringan, whither he now travels by my counsel, and by the aid of good
      Catholics,&mdash;when he returns, healed, of his wasting malady, high in
      health, and strong in limb, will not the glory of his faithfulness, and
      its miraculous reward, speak louder in the ears of this besotted people of
      Scotland, than the din which is weekly made in a thousand heretical
      pulpits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but, mother, I fear the Saint's hand is out. It is long since we have
      heard of a miracle performed at St. Ringan's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matron made a dead pause, and, with a voice tremulous with emotion,
      asked, &ldquo;Art thou so unhappy as to doubt the power of the blessed Saint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, mother,&rdquo; the youth hastened to reply, &ldquo;I believe as the Holy Church
      commands, and doubt not Saint Ringan's power of healing; but, be it said
      with reverence, he hath not of late showed the inclination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has this land deserved it?&rdquo; said the Catholic matron, advancing
      hastily while she spoke, until she attained the summit of a rising ground,
      over which the path led, and then standing again still. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;stood the Cross, the limits of the Halidome of Saint Mary's&mdash;here&mdash;on
      this eminence&mdash;from which the eye of the holy pilgrim might first
      catch a view of that ancient monastery, the light of the land, the abode
      of Saints, and the grave of monarchs&mdash;Where is now that emblem of our
      faith? It lies on the earth&mdash;a shapeless block, from which the broken
      fragments have been carried off, for the meanest uses, till now no
      semblance of its original form remains. Look towards the east, my son,
      where the sun was wont to glitter on stately spires&mdash;from which
      crosses and bells have now been hurled, as if the land had been invaded
      once more by barbarous heathens.&mdash;Look at yonder battlements, of
      which we can, even at this distance, descry the partial demolition; and
      ask if this land can expect from the blessed saints, whose shrines and
      whose images have been profaned, any other miracles but those of
      vengeance? How long,&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking upward, &ldquo;How long shall it be
      delayed?&rdquo; She paused, and then resumed with enthusiastic rapidity, &ldquo;Yes,
      my son, all on earth is but for a period&mdash;joy and grief, triumph and
      desolation, succeed each other like cloud and sunshine;&mdash;the vineyard
      shall not be forever trodden down, the gaps shall be amended, and the
      fruitful branches once more dressed and trimmed. Even this day&mdash;ay,
      even this hour, I trust to hear news of importance. Dally not&mdash;let us
      on&mdash;time is brief, and judgment is certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She resumed the path which led to the Abbey&mdash;a path which, in ancient
      times, was carefully marked out by posts and rails, to assist the pilgrim
      in his journey&mdash;these were now torn up and destroyed. A half-hour's
      walk placed them in front of the once splendid Monastery, which, although
      the church was as yet entire, had not escaped the fury of the times. The
      long range of cells and of apartments for the use of the brethren, which
      occupied two sides of the great square, were almost entirely ruinous, the
      interior having been consumed by fire, which only the massive architecture
      of the outward walls had enabled them to resist. The Abbot's house, which
      formed the third side of the square, was, though injured, still inhabited,
      and afforded refuge to the few brethren, who yet, rather by connivance
      than by actual authority,&mdash;were permitted to remain at Kennaquhair.
      Their stately offices&mdash;their pleasant gardens&mdash;the magnificent
      cloisters constructed for their recreation, were all dilapidated and
      ruinous; and some of the building materials had apparently been put into
      requisition by persons in the village and in the vicinity, who, formerly
      vassals of the Monastery, had not hesitated to appropriate to themselves a
      part of the spoils. Roland saw fragments of Gothic pillars richly carved,
      occupying the place of door-posts to the meanest huts; and here and there
      a mutilated statue, inverted or laid on its side, made the door-post, or
      threshold, of a wretched cow-house. The church itself was less injured
      than the other buildings of the Monastery. But the images which had been
      placed in the numerous niches of its columns and buttresses, having all
      fallen under the charge of idolatry, to which the superstitious devotion
      of the Papists had justly exposed them, had been broken and thrown down,
      without much regard to the preservation of the rich and airy canopies and
      pedestals on which they were placed; nor, if the devastation had stopped
      short at this point, could we have considered the preservation of these
      monuments of antiquity as an object to be put in the balance with the
      introduction of the reformed worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our pilgrims saw the demolition of these sacred and venerable
      representations of saints and angels&mdash;for as sacred and venerable
      they had been taught to consider them&mdash;with very different feelings.
      The antiquary may be permitted to regret the necessity of the action, but
      to Magdalen Graeme it seemed a deed of impiety, deserving the instant
      vengeance of heaven,&mdash;a sentiment in which her relative joined for
      the moment as cordially as herself. Neither, however, gave vent to their
      feelings in words, and uplifted hands and eyes formed their only mode of
      expressing them. The page was about to approach the great eastern gate of
      the church, but was prevented by his guide. &ldquo;That gate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has
      long been blockaded, that the heretical rabble may not know there still
      exist among the brethren of Saint Mary's men who dare worship where their
      predecessors prayed while alive, and were interred when dead&mdash;follow
      me this way, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme followed accordingly; and Magdalen, casting a hasty glance
      to see whether they were observed, (for she had learned caution from the
      danger of the times,) commanded her grandson to knock at a little wicket
      which she pointed out to him. &ldquo;But knock gently,&rdquo; she added, with a motion
      expressive of caution. After a little space, during which no answer was
      returned, she signed to Roland to repeat his summons for admission; and
      the door at length partially opening, discovered a glimpse of the thin and
      timid porter, by whom the duty was performed, skulking from the
      observation of those who stood without; but endeavouring at the same time
      to gain a sight of them without being himself seen. How different from the
      proud consciousness of dignity with which the porter of ancient days
      offered his important brow, and his goodly person, to the pilgrims who
      repaired to Kennaquhair! His solemn &ldquo;<i>Intrate, mei filii,</i>&rdquo; was
      exchanged for a tremulous &ldquo;You cannot enter now&mdash;the brethren are in
      their chambers.&rdquo; But, when Magdalen Graeme asked, in an under tone of
      voice, &ldquo;Hast thou forgotten me, my brother?&rdquo; he changed his apologetic
      refusal to &ldquo;Enter, my honoured sister, enter speedily, for evil eyes are
      upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered accordingly, and having waited until the porter had, with
      jealous haste, barred and bolted the wicket, were conducted by him through
      several dark and winding passages. As they walked slowly on, he spoke to
      the matron in a subdued voice, as if he feared to trust the very walls
      with the avowal which he communicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Fathers are assembled in the Chapter-house, worthy sister&mdash;yes,
      in the Chapter-house&mdash;for the election of an Abbott.&mdash;Ah,
      Benedicite! there must be no ringing of bells&mdash;no high mass&mdash;no
      opening of the great gates now, that the people might see and venerate
      their spiritual Father! Our Fathers must hide themselves rather like
      robbers who choose a leader, than godly priests who elect a mitred Abbot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regard not that, my brother,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;the first
      successors of Saint Peter himself were elected, not in sunshine, but in
      tempests&mdash;not in the halls of the Vatican, but in the subterranean
      vaults and dungeons of heathen Rome&mdash;they were not gratulated with
      shouts and salvos of cannon-shot and of musketry, and the display of
      artificial fire&mdash;no, my brother&mdash;but by the hoarse summons of
      Lictors and Praetors, who came to drag the Fathers of the Church to
      martyrdom. From such adversity was the Church once raised, and by such
      will it now be purified.&mdash;And mark me, brother! not in the proudest
      days of the mitred Abbey, was a Superior ever chosen, whom his office
      shall so much honour, as <i>he</i> shall be honoured, who now takes it
      upon him in these days of tribulation. On whom, my brother, will the
      choice fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whom can it fall&mdash;or, alas! who would dare to reply to the call,
      save the worthy pupil of the Sainted Eustatius&mdash;the good and valiant
      Father Ambrose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Magdalen; &ldquo;my heart told me long ere your lips had
      uttered his name. Stand forth, courageous champion, and man the fatal
      breach!&mdash;Rise, bold and experienced pilot, and seize the helm while
      the tempest rages!&mdash;Turn back the battle, brave raiser of the fallen
      standard!&mdash;Wield crook and slang, noble shepherd of a scattered
      flock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, hush, my sister!&rdquo; said the porter, opening a door which led
      into the great church, &ldquo;the brethren will be presently here to celebrate
      their election with a solemn mass&mdash;I must marshal them the way to the
      high altar&mdash;all the offices of this venerable house have now devolved
      on one poor decrepit old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the church, and Magdalen and Roland remained alone in that great
      vaulted space, whose style of rich, yet chaste architecture, referred its
      origin to the early part of the fourteenth century, the best period of
      Gothic building. But the niches were stripped of their images in the
      inside as well as the outside of the church; and in the pell-mell havoc,
      the tombs of warriors and of princes had been included in the demolition
      of the idolatrous shrines. Lances and swords of antique size, which had
      hung over the tombs of mighty warriors of former days, lay now strewed
      among relics, with which the devotion of pilgrims had graced those of
      their peculiar saints; and the fragments of the knights and dames, which
      had once lain recumbent, or kneeled in an attitude of devotion, where
      their mortal relics were reposed, were mingled with those of the saints
      and angels of the Gothic chisel, which the hand of violence had sent
      headlong from their stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most fatal symptom of the whole appeared to be, that, though this
      violence had now been committed for many months, the Fathers had lost so
      totally all heart and resolution, that they had not adventured even upon
      clearing away the rubbish, or restoring the church to some decent degree
      of order. This might have been done without much labour. But terror had
      overpowered the scanty remains of a body once so powerful, and, sensible
      they were only suffered to remain in this ancient seat by connivance and
      from compassion, they did not venture upon taking any step which might be
      construed into an assertion of their ancient rights, contenting themselves
      with the secret and obscure exercise of their religious ceremonial, in as
      unostentatious a manner as was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three of the more aged brethren had sunk under the pressure of the
      times, and the ruins had been partly cleared away to permit their
      interment. One stone had been laid over Father Nicholas, which recorded of
      him in special, that he had taken the vows during the incumbency of Abbot
      Ingelram, the period to which his memory so frequently recurred. Another
      flag-stone, yet more recently deposited, covered the body of Philip the
      Sacristan, eminent for his aquatic excursion with the phantom of Avenel,
      and a third, the most recent of all, bore the outline of a mitre, and the
      words <i>Hic jacet Eustatius Abbas</i>; for no one dared to add a word of
      commendation in favour of his learning, and strenuous zeal for the Roman
      Catholic faith.

      Magdalen Graeme looked at and perused the brief records of these monuments
      successively, and paused over that of Father Eustace. &ldquo;In a good hour for
      thyself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but oh! in an evil hour for the Church, wert thou
      called from us. Let thy spirit be with us, holy man&mdash;encourage thy
      successor to tread in thy footsteps&mdash;give him thy bold and inventive
      capacity, thy zeal and thy discretion&mdash;even <i>thy</i> piety exceeds
      not his.&rdquo; As she spoke, a side door, which closed a passage from the
      Abbot's house into the church, was thrown open, that the Fathers might
      enter the choir, and conduct to the high altar the Superior whom they had
      elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In former times, this was one of the most splendid of the many pageants
      which the hierarchy of Rome had devised to attract the veneration of the
      faithful. The period during which the Abbacy remained vacant, was a state
      of mourning, or, as their emblematical phrase expressed it, of widowhood;
      a melancholy term, which was changed into rejoicing and triumph when a new
      Superior was chosen. When the folding doors were on such solemn occasions
      thrown open, and the new Abbot appeared on the threshold in full-blown
      dignity, with ring and mitre, and dalmatique and crosier, his hoary
      standard-bearers and his juvenile dispensers of incense preceding him, and
      the venerable train of monks behind him, with all besides which could
      announce the supreme authority to which he was now raised, his appearance
      was a signal for the magnificent <i>jubilate</i> to rise from the organ
      and music-loft, and to be joined by the corresponding bursts of Alleluiah
      from the whole assembled congregation. Now all was changed. In the midst
      of rubbish and desolation, seven or eight old men, bent and shaken as much
      by grief and fear as by age, shrouded hastily in the proscribed dress of
      their order, wandered like a procession of spectres, from the door which
      had been thrown open, up through the encumbered passage, to the high
      altar, there to instal their elected Superior a chief of ruins. It was
      like a band of bewildered travellers choosing a chief in the wilderness of
      Arabia; or a shipwrecked crew electing a captain upon the barren island on
      which fate has thrown them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who, in peaceful times, are most ambitious of authority among others,
      shrink from the competition at such eventful periods, when neither ease
      nor parade attend the possession of it, and when it gives only a painful
      pre-eminence both in danger and in labour, and exposes the ill-fated
      chieftain to the murmurs of his discontented associates, as well as to the
      first assault of the common enemy. But he on whom the office of the Abbot
      of Saint Mary's was now conferred, had a mind fitted for the situation to
      which he was called. Bold and enthusiastic, yet generous and forgiving&mdash;wise
      and skilful, yet zealous and prompt&mdash;he wanted but a better cause
      than the support of a decaying superstition, to have raised him to the
      rank of a truly great man. But as the end crowns the work, it also forms
      the rule by which it must be ultimately judged; and those who, with
      sincerity and generosity, fight and fall in an evil cause, posterity can
      only compassionate as victims of a generous but fatal error. Amongst
      these, we must rank Ambrosius, the last Abbot of Kennaqubair, whose
      designs must be condemned, as their success would have riveted on Scotland
      the chains of antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny; but whose
      talents commanded respect, and whose virtues, even from the enemies of his
      faith, extorted esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearing of the new Abbot served of itself to dignify a ceremonial
      which was deprived of all other attributes of grandeur. Conscious of the
      peril in which they stood, and recalling, doubtless, the better days they
      had seen, there hung over his brethren an appearance of mingled terror,
      and grief, and shame, which induced them to hurry over the office in which
      they were engaged, as something at once degrading and dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not so Father Ambrose. His features, indeed, expressed a deep
      melancholy, as he walked up the centre aisle, amid the ruin of things
      which he considered as holy, but his brow was undejected, and his step
      firm and solemn. He seemed to think that the dominion which he was about
      to receive, depended in no sort upon the external circumstances under
      which it was conferred; and if a mind so firm was accessible to sorrow or
      fear, it was not on his own account, but on that of the Church to which he
      had devoted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he stood on the broken steps of the high altar, barefooted, as
      was the rule, and holding in his hand his pastoral staff, for the gemmed
      ring and jewelled mitre had become secular spoils. No obedient vassals
      came, man after man, to make their homage, and to offer the tribute which
      should provide their spiritual Superior with palfrey and trappings. No
      Bishop assisted at the solemnity, to receive into the higher ranks of the
      Church nobility a dignitary, whose voice in the legislature was as
      potential as his own. With hasty and maimed rites, the few remaining
      brethren stepped forward alternately to give their new Abbot the kiss of
      peace, in token of fraternal affection and spiritual homage. Mass was then
      hastily performed, but in such precipitation as if it had been hurried
      over rather to satisfy the scruples of a few youths, who were impatient to
      set out on a hunting party, than as if it made the most solemn part of a
      solemn ordination. The officiating priest faltered as he spoke the
      service, and often looked around, as if he expected to be interrupted in
      the midst of his office; and the brethren listened to that which, short as
      it was, they wished yet more abridged.[Footnote: In Catholic countries, in
      order to reconcile the pleasures of the great with the observances of
      religion, it was common, when a party was bent for the chase, to celebrate
      mass, abridged and maimed of its rites, called a hunting-mass, the brevity
      of which was designed to correspond with the impatience of the audience.]
    </p>
    <p>
      These symptoms of alarm increased as the ceremony proceeded, and, as it
      seemed, were not caused by mere apprehension alone; for, amid the pauses
      of the hymn, there were heard without sounds of a very different sort,
      beginning faintly and at a distance, but at length approaching close to
      the exterior of the church, and stunning with dissonant clamour those
      engaged in the service. The winding of horns, blown with no regard to
      harmony or concert; the jangling of bells, the thumping of drums, the
      squeaking of bagpipes, and the clash of cymbals&mdash;the shouts of a
      multitude, now as in laughter, now as in anger&mdash;the shrill tones of
      female voices, and of those of children, mingling with the deeper clamour
      of men, formed a Babel of sounds, which first drowned, and then awed into
      utter silence, the official hymns of the Convent. The cause and result of
      this extraordinary interruption will be explained in the next chapter.

                              THE CONSPIRACY.
</pre>
    <p>
      The monks ceased their song, which, like that of the choristers in the
      legend of the Witch of Berkley, died away in a quaver of consternation;
      and, like a flock of chickens disturbed by the presence of the kite, they
      at first made a movement to disperse and fly in different directions, and
      then, with despair, rather than hope, huddled themselves around their new
      Abbot; who, retaining the lofty and undismayed look which had dignified
      him through the whole ceremony, stood on the higher step of the altar, as
      if desirous to be the most conspicuous mark on which danger might
      discharge itself, and to save his companions by his self-devotion, since
      he could afford them no other protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, as it were, Magdalen Graeme and the page stepped from the
      station which hitherto they had occupied unnoticed, and approached to the
      altar, as desirous of sharing the fate which approached the monks,
      whatever that might be. Both bowed reverently low to the Abbot; and while
      Magdalen seemed about to speak, the youth, looking towards the main
      entrance, at which the noise now roared most loudly, and which was at the
      same time assailed with much knocking, laid his hand upon his dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot motioned to both to forbear: &ldquo;Peace, my sister,&rdquo; he said, in a
      low tone, but which, being in a different key from the tumultuary sounds
      without, could be distinctly heard, even amidst the tumult;&mdash;&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;my sister; let the new Superior of Saint Mary's himself receive
      and reply to the grateful acclamations of the vassals, who come to
      celebrate his installation.&mdash;And thou, my son, forbear, I charge
      thee, to touch thy earthly weapon;&mdash;if it is the pleasure of our
      protectress, that her shrine be this day desecrated by deeds of violence,
      and polluted by blood-shedding, let it not, I charge thee, happen through
      the deed of a Catholic son of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise and knocking at the outer gate became now every moment louder;
      and voices were heard impatiently demanding admittance. The Abbot, with
      dignity, and with a step which even the emergency of danger rendered
      neither faltering nor precipitate, moved towards the portal, and demanded
      to know, in a tone of authority, who it was that disturbed their worship,
      and what they desired?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, and then a loud laugh from without. At
      length a voice replied, &ldquo;We desire entrance into the church; and when the
      door is opened you will soon see who we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whose authority do you require entrance?&rdquo; said the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By authority of the right reverend Lord Abbot of Unreason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: We learn from no less authority than that of Napoleon
      Bonaparte, that there is but a single step between the sublime and
      ridiculous; and it is a transition from one extreme to another; so very
      easy, that the vulgar of every degree are peculiarly captivated with it.
      Thus the inclination to laugh becomes uncontrollable, when the solemnity
      and gravity of time, place, and circumstances, render it peculiarly
      improper. Some species of general license, like that which inspired the
      ancient Saturnalia, or the modern Carnival, has been commonly indulged to
      the people at all times and in almost all countries. But it was, I think,
      peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church, that while they studied how to
      render their church rites imposing and magnificent, by all that pomp,
      music, architecture, and external display could add to them, they
      nevertheless connived, upon special occasions, at the frolics of the rude
      vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least
      assumed, the privilege of making: some Lord of the revels, who, under the
      name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy Bishop, or the President of Fools,
      occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock imitation of the
      sacred rites, and sung indecent parodies on hymns of the church. The
      indifference of the clergy, even when their power was greatest, to the
      indecent exhibitions which they always tolerated, and sometimes
      encouraged, forms a strong contrast to the sensitiveness with which they
      regarded any serious attempt, by preaching or writing, to impeach any of
      the doctrines of the church. It could only be compared to the singular
      apathy with which they endured, and often admired the gross novels which
      Chaucer, Dunbar, Boccacio, Bandello, and others, composed upon the bad
      morals of the clergy. It seems as if the churchmen in both instances had
      endeavoured to compromise with the laity, and allowed them occasionally to
      gratify their coarse humour by indecent satire, provided they would
      abstain from any grave question concerning the foundation of the doctrines
      on which was erected such an immense fabric of ecclesiastical power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sports thus licensed assumed a very different appearance, so soon
      as the Protestant doctrines began to prevail; and the license which their
      forefathers had exercised in mere gaiety of heart, and without the least
      intention of dishonouring religion by their frolics, were now persevered
      in by the common people as a mode of testifying their utter disregard for
      the Roman priesthood and its ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may observe, for example, the case of an apparitor sent to Borthwick
      from the Primate of Saint Andrews, to cite the lord of that castle, who
      was opposed by an Abbot of Unreason, at whose command the officer of the
      spiritual court was appointed to be ducked in a mill-dam, and obliged to
      eat up his parchment citation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may be amused with the following whimsical details of this
      incident, which took place in the castle of Borthwick, in the year 1517.
      It appears, that in consequence of a process betwixt Master George Hay de
      Minzeane and the Lord Borthwick, letters of excommunication had passed
      against the latter, on account of the contumacy of certain witnesses.
      William Langlands, an apparitor or macer (<i>bacularius</i>) of the See of
      St Andrews, presented these letters to the curate of the church of
      Borthwick, requiring him to publish the same at the service of high mass.
      It seems that the inhabitants of the castle were at this time engaged in
      the favourite sport of enacting the Abbot of Unreason, a species of high
      jinks, in which a mimic prelate was elected, who, like the Lord of Misrule
      in England, turned all sort of lawful authority, and particularly the
      church ritual, into ridicule. This frolicsome person with his retinue,
      notwithstanding of the apparitor's character, entered the church, seized
      upon the primate's officer without hesitation, and, dragging him to the
      mill-dam on the south side of the castle, compelled him to leap into the
      water. Not contented with this partial immersion, the Abbot of Unreason
      pronounced, that Mr. William Langlands was not yet sufficiently bathed,
      and therefore caused his assistants to lay him on his back in the stream,
      and duck him in the most satisfactory and perfect manner. The unfortunate
      apparitor was then conducted back to the church, where, for his
      refreshment after his bath, the letters of excommunication were torn to
      pieces, and steeped in a bowl of wine; the mock abbot being probably of
      opinion that a tough parchment was but dry eating, Langlands was compelled
      to eat the letters, and swallow the wine, and dismissed by the Abbot of
      Unreason, with the comfortable assurance, that if any more such letters
      should arrive during the continuance of his office, &ldquo;they should a' gang
      the same gate,&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i> go the same road.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar scene occurs betwixt a sumner of the Bishop of Rochester, and
      Harpool, the servant of Lord Cobham, in the old play of Sir John
      Oldcastle, when the former compels the church-officer to eat his citation.
      The dialogue, which may be found in the note, contains most of the jests
      which may be supposed, appropriate to such an extraordinary occasion:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool</i> Marry, sir, is, this process parchment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> Yes, marry is it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> And this seal wax?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> It is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> If this be parchment, and this be wax, eat you this
      parchment and wax, or I will make parchment of your skin, and beat your
      brains into wax. Sirrah Sumner, despatch&mdash;devour, sirrah, devour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> I am my Lord of Rochester's sumner; I came to do my office,
      and thou shall answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> Sirrah, no railing, but, betake thyself to thy teeth. Thou
      shalt, eat no worse than thou bringest with thee. Thou bringest it for my
      lord; and wilt thou bring my lord worse than thou wilt eat thyself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> Sir. I brought it not my lord to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> O, do you Sir me now? All's one for that; I'll make you
      eat it for bringing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> I cannot eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> Can you not? 'Sblood, I'll beat you till you have a
      stomach! (<i>Beats him.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> Oh, hold, hold, good Mr. Servingman; I will eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> Be champing, be chewing, sir, or I will chew you, you
      rogue. Tough wax is the purest of the honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> The purest of the honey?&mdash;O Lord, sir, oh! oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> Feed, feed; 'tis wholesome, rogue, wholesome. Cannot you,
      like an honest sumner, walk with the devil your brother, to fetch in your
      bailiff's rents, but you must come to a nobleman's house with process! If
      the seal were broad as the lead which covers Rochester Church, thou
      shouldst eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sumner.</i> Oh, I am almost choked&mdash;I am almost choked!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Harpool.</i> Who's within there? Will you shame my lord? Is there no
      beer in the house? Butler, I say.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Enter</i> BUTLER.

    <p>
      <i>Butler.</i> Here, here.

</pre>
    <p>
      replied the voice from without; and, from the laugh&mdash;which followed,
      it seemed as if there was something highly ludicrous couched under this
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, and seek not to know, your meaning,&rdquo; replied the Abbot,
      &ldquo;since it is probably a rude one. But begone, in the name of God, and
      leave his servants in peace. I speak this, as having lawful authority to
      command here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; said another rude voice, &ldquo;and we will try titles with
      you, Sir Monk, and show you a superior we must all obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break open the doors if he dallies any longer,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;and down
      with the carrion monks who would bar us of our privilege!&rdquo; A general shout
      followed. &ldquo;Ay, ay, our privilege! our privilege! down with the doors, and
      with the lurdane monks, if they make opposition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knocking was now exchanged for blows with great, hammers, to which the
      doors, strong as they were, must soon have given way. But the Abbot, who
      saw resistance would be in vain, and who did not wish to incense the
      assailants by an attempt at offering it, besought silence earnestly, and
      with difficulty obtained a hearing. &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will save
      you from committing a great sin. The porter will presently undo the gate&mdash;he
      is gone to fetch the keys&mdash;meantime I pray you to consider with
      yourselves, if you are in a state of mind to cross the holy threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tillyvally for your papistry!&rdquo; was answered from without; &ldquo;we are in the
      mood of the monks when they are merriest, and that is when they sup
      beef-brewis for lanten-kail. So, if your porter hath not the gout, let him
      come speedily, or we heave away readily.&mdash;Said I well, comrades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravely said, and it shall be as bravely done,&rdquo; said the multitude; and
      had not the keys arrived at that moment, and the porter in hasty terror
      performed his office, throwing open the great door, the populace would
      have saved him the trouble. The instant he had done so, the affrighted
      janitor fled, like one who has drawn the bolts of a flood-gate, and
      expects to be overwhelmed by the rushing inundation. The monks, with one
      consent, had withdrawn themselves behind the Abbot, who alone kept his
      station, about three yards from the entrance, showing no signs of fear or
      perturbation. His brethren&mdash;partly encouraged by his devotion, partly
      ashamed to desert him, and partly animated by a sense of duty.&mdash;remained
      huddled close together, at the back of their Superior. There was a loud
      laugh and huzza when the doors were opened; but, contrary to what might
      have been expected, no crowd of enraged assailants rushed into the church.
      On the contrary, there was a cry of &ldquo;A halt!-a halt&mdash;to order, my
      masters! and let the two reverend fathers greet each other, as beseems
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the crowd who were thus called to order, was grotesque
      in the extreme. It was composed of men, women, and children, ludicrously
      disguised in various habits, and presenting groups equally diversified and
      grotesque. Here one fellow with a horse's head painted before him, and a
      tail behind, and the whole covered with a long foot-cloth, which was
      supposed to hide the body of the animal, ambled, caracoled, pranced, and
      plunged, as he performed the celebrated part of the hobby-horse,
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: This exhibition, the play-mare of Scotland, stood high among
      holyday gambols. It must be carefully separated from the wooden chargers
      which furnish out our nurseries. It gives rise to Hamlet's ejaculation,&mdash;

    But oh, but oh, the hobby-horse is forgot!

      There is a very comic scene in Beaumont and Fletcher's play of &ldquo;Woman
      Pleased,&rdquo; where Hope-on-high Bombye, a puritan cobbler, refuses to dance
      with the hobby-horse. There was much difficulty and great variety in the
      motions which the hobby-horse was expected to exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned Mr. Douce, who has contributed so much to the illustration of
      our theatrical antiquities, has given us a full account of this pageant,
      and the burlesque horsemanship which it practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hobby-horse,&rdquo; says Mr. Douce, &ldquo;was represented by a man equipped with
      as much pasteboard as was sufficient to form the head and hinder parts of
      a horse, the quadrupedal defects being concealed by a long mantle or
      footcloth that nearly touched the ground. The former, on this occasion,
      exerted all his skill in burlesque horsemanship. In Sympson's play of the
      Law-breakers, 1636, a miller personates the hobby-horse, and being angry
      that the Mayor of the city is put in competition with him, exclaims, 'Let
      the mayor play the hobby-horse among his brethren, an he will; I hope our
      town-lads cannot want a hobby-horse. Have I practised my reins, my
      careers, my prankers, my ambles, my false trots, my smooth ambles, and
      Canterbury paces, and shall master mayor put me beside the hobby-horse?
      Have I borrowed the fore-horse bells, his plumes, his braveries; nay, had
      his mane new shorn and frizzled, and shall the mayor put me beside the
      hobby-horse?&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Douce's Illustrations</i>, vol. II. p. 468]

      so often alluded to in our ancient drama; and which still flourishes on
      the stage in the battle that concludes Bayes's tragedy. To rival the
      address and agility displayed by this character, another personage
      advanced in the more formidable character of a huge dragon, with gilded
      wings, open jaws, and a scarlet tongue, cloven at the end, which made
      various efforts to overtake and devour a lad, dressed as the lovely
      Sabaea, daughter of the King of Egypt, who fled before him; while a
      martial Saint George, grotesquely armed with a goblet for a helmet, and a
      spit for a lance, ever and anon interfered, and compelled the monster to
      relinquish his prey. A bear, a wolf, and one or two other wild animals,
      played their parts with the discretion of Snug the joiner; for the decided
      preference which they gave to the use of their hind legs, was sufficient,
      without any formal annunciation, to assure the most timorous spectators
      that they had to do with habitual bipeds. There was a group of outlaws
      with Robin Hood and Little John at their head
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The representation of Robin Hood was the darling Maygame both
      in England and Scotland, and doubtless the favourite personification was
      often revived, when the Abbot of Unreason, or other pretences of frolic,
      gave an unusual decree of license.

      The Protestant clergy, who had formerly reaped advantage from the
      opportunities which these sports afforded them of directing their own
      satire and the ridicule of the lower orders against the Catholic church,
      began to find that, when these purposes were served, their favourite
      pastimes deprived them of the wish to attend divine worship, and disturbed
      the frame of mind in which it can be attended to advantage. The celebrated
      Bishop Latimer gives a very <i>naive</i> account of the manner in which,
      bishop as he was, he found himself compelled to give place to Robin Hood
      and his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came once myselfe riding on a journey homeward from London, and I sent
      word over night into the towne that I would preach there in the morning,
      because it was holiday, and me thought it was a holidayes worke. The
      church stood in my way, and I took my horse and my company, and went
      thither, (I thought I should have found a great company in the church,)
      and when I came there the church doore was fast locked. I tarryed there
      halfe an houre and more. At last the key was found, and one of the parish
      comes to me and said,&mdash;'Sir, this is a busie day with us, we cannot
      hear you; it is Robin Hood's day. The parish are gone abroad to gather for
      Robin Hood. I pray you let them not.' I was faine there to give place to
      Robin Hood. I thought my rochet should have been regarded, though I were
      not: but it would not serve, it was faine to give place to Robin Hood's
      men. It is no laughing matter, my friends, it is a weeping matter, a
      heavie matter, a heavie matter. Under the pretence for gathering for Robin
      Hood, a traytour, and a theif, to put out a preacher; to have his office
      lesse esteemed; to preferre Robin Hood before the ministration of God's
      word; and all this hath come of unpreaching prelates. This realme hath
      been ill provided for, that it hath had such corrupt judgments in it, to
      prefer Robin Hood to God's word.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bishop Latimer's sixth Sermon
      before King Edward</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the English Protestants thus preferred the outlaw's pageant to the
      preaching of their excellent Bishop, the Scottish calvinistic clergy, with
      the celebrated John Knox at their head, and backed by the authority of the
      magistrates of Edinburgh, who had of late been chosen exclusively from
      this party, found it impossible to control the rage of the populace, when
      they attempted to deprive them of the privilege of presenting their
      pageant of Robin Hood.

    <p>
      John Knox, who writes at large upon this tumult, informs us it was
      inflamed by the deacons of craftes, who, resenting; the superiority
      assumed over them by the magistrates, would yield no assistance to put
      down the tumult. &ldquo;They will be magistrates alone,&rdquo; said the recusant
      deacons, &ldquo;e'en let them rule the populace alone;&rdquo; and accordingly they
      passed quietly to take <i>their four-hours penny</i>, and left the
      magistrates to help themselves as they could. Many persons were
      excommunicated for this outrage, and not admitted to church ordinances
      till they had made satisfaction.] &mdash;the best representation exhibited
      at the time; and no great wonder, since most of the actors were, by
      profession, the banished men and thieves whom they presented. Other
      masqueraders there were, of a less marked description. Men were disguised
      as women, and women as men&mdash;children wore the dress of aged people,
      and tottered with crutch-sticks in their hands, furred gowns on their
      little backs, and caps on their round heads&mdash;while grandsires assumed
      the infantine tone as well as the dress of children. Besides these, many
      had their faces painted, and wore their shirts over the rest of their
      dress; while coloured pasteboard and ribbons furnished out decorations for
      others. Those who wanted all these properties, blacked their faces, and
      turned their jackets inside out; and thus the transmutation of the whole
      assembly into a set of mad grotesque mummers, was at once completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause which the masqueraders made, waiting apparently for some person
      of the highest authority amongst them, gave those within the Abbey Church
      full time to observe all these absurdities. They were at no loss to
      comprehend their purpose and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few readers can be ignorant, that at an early period, and during the
      plenitude of her power, the Church of Rome not only connived at, but even
      encouraged, such Saturnalian licenses as the inhabitants of Kennaquhair
      and the neighbourhood had now in hand, and that the vulgar, on such
      occasions, were not only permitted but encouraged by a number of gambols,
      sometimes puerile and ludicrous, sometimes immoral and profane, to
      indemnify themselves for the privations and penances imposed on them at
      other seasons. But, of all other topics for burlesque and ridicule, the
      rites and ceremonial of the church itself were most frequently resorted
      to; and, strange to say, with the approbation of the clergy themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the hierarchy flourished in full glory, they do not appear to have
      dreaded the consequences of suffering the people to become so irreverently
      familiar with things sacred; they then imagined the laity to be much in
      the condition of the labourer's horse, which does not submit to the bridle
      and the whip with greater reluctance, because, at rare intervals, he is
      allowed to frolic at large in his pasture, and fling out his heels in
      clumsy gambols at the master who usually drives him. But, when times
      changed&mdash;when doubt of the Roman Catholic doctrine, and hatred of
      their priesthood, had possessed the reformed party, the clergy discovered,
      too late, that no small inconvenience arose from the established practice
      of games and merry-makings, in which they themselves, and all they held
      most sacred, were made the subject of ridicule. It then became obvious to
      duller politicians than the Romish churchmen, that the same actions have a
      very different tendency when done in the spirit of sarcastic insolence and
      hatred, than when acted merely in exuberance of rude and uncontrollable
      spirits. They, therefore, though of the latest, endeavoured, where they
      had any remaining influence, to discourage the renewal of these indecorous
      festivities. In this particular, the Catholic clergy were joined by most
      of the reformed preachers, who were more shocked at the profanity and
      immorality of many of these exhibitions, than disposed to profit by the
      ridiculous light in which they placed the Church of Rome and her
      observances. But it was long ere these scandalous and immoral sports could
      be abrogated;&mdash;the rude multitude continued attached to their
      favourite pastimes, and, both in England and Scotland, the mitre of the
      Catholic&mdash;the rochet of the reformed bishop&mdash;and the cloak and
      band of the Calvinistic divine&mdash;were, in turn, compelled to give
      place to those jocular personages, the Pope of Fools, the Boy-Bishop, and
      the Abbot of Unreason. [Footnote: From the interesting novel entitled
      Anastasius, it seems the same burlesque ceremonies were practised in the
      Greek Church. ]
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the latter personage who now, in full costume, made his approach to
      the great door of the church of St. Mary's, accoutred in such a manner as
      to form a caricature, or practical parody, on the costume and attendants
      of the real Superior, whom he came to beard on the very day of his
      installation, in the presence of his clergy, and in the chancel of his
      church. The mock dignitary was a stout-made under-sized fellow, whose
      thick squab form had been rendered grotesque by a supplemental paunch,
      well stuffed. He wore a mitre of leather, with the front like a
      grenadier's cap, adorned with mock embroidery, and trinkets of tin. This
      surmounted a visage, the nose of which was the most prominent feature,
      being of unusual size, and at least as richly gemmed as his head-gear. His
      robe was of buckram, and his cope of canvass, curiously painted, and cut
      into open work. On one shoulder was fixed the painted figure of an owl;
      and he bore in the right hand his pastoral staff, and in the left a small
      mirror having a handle to it, thus resembling a celebrated jester, whose
      adventures, translated into English, were whilom extremely popular, and
      which may still be procured in black letter, for about one sterling pound
      per leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendants of this mock dignitary had their proper dresses and
      equipage, bearing the same burlesque resemblance to the officers of the
      Convent which their leader did to the Superior. They followed their leader
      in regular procession, and the motley characters, which had waited his
      arrival, now crowded into the church in his train, shouting as they came,&mdash;&ldquo;A
      hall, a hall! for the venerable Father Howleglas, the learned Monk of
      Misrule, and the Right Reverend Abbot of Unreason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The discordant minstrelsy of every kind renewed its din; the boys shrieked
      and howled, and the men laughed and hallooed, and the women giggled and
      screamed, and the beasts roared, and the dragon wallopped and hissed, and
      the hobby-horse neighed, pranced, and capered, and the rest frisked and
      frolicked, clashing their hobnailed shoes against the pavement, till it
      sparkled with the marks of their energetic caprioles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fine, a scene of ridiculous confusion, that deafened the ear,
      made the eyes giddy, and must have altogether stunned any indifferent
      spectator; the monks, whom personal apprehension and a consciousness that
      much of the popular enjoyment arose from the ridicule being directed
      against them, were, moreover, little comforted by the reflection, that,
      bold in their disguise, the mummers who whooped and capered around them,
      might, on slight provocation, turn their jest into earnest, or at least
      proceed to those practical pleasantries, which at all times arise so
      naturally out of the frolicsome and mischievous disposition of the
      populace. They looked to their Abbot amid the tumult, with such looks as
      landsmen cast upon the pilot when the storm is at the highest&mdash;looks
      which express that they are devoid of all hope arising from their own
      exertions, and not very confident in any success likely to attend those of
      their Palinurus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot himself seemed at a stand; he felt no fear, but he was sensible
      of the danger of expressing his rising indignation, which he was scarcely
      able to suppress. He made a gesture with his hand as if commanding
      silence, which was at first only replied to by redoubled shouts, and peals
      of wild laughter. When, however, the same motion, and as nearly in the
      same manner, had been made by Howleglas, it was immediately obeyed by his
      riotous companions, who expected fresh food for mirth in the conversation
      betwixt the real and mock Abbot, having no small confidence in the vulgar
      wit and impudence of their leader. Accordingly, they began to shout, &ldquo;To
      it, fathers&mdash;to it I&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fight monk, fight madcap&mdash;Abbot
      against Abbot is fair play, and so is reason against unreason, and malice
      against monkery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, my mates!&rdquo; said Howleglas; &ldquo;cannot two learned Fathers of the
      Church hold communion together, but you must come here with your
      bear-garden whoop and hollo, as if you were hounding forth a mastiff upon
      a mad bull? I say silence! and let this learned Father and me confer,
      touching matters affecting our mutual state and authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children&rdquo;&mdash;said Father Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> children too,&mdash;and happy children they are!&rdquo; said his
      burlesque counterpart; &ldquo;many a wise child knows not its own father, and it
      is well they have two to choose betwixt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou hast aught in thee, save scoffing and ribaldry,&rdquo; said the real
      Abbot, &ldquo;permit me, for thine own soul's sake, to speak a few words to
      these misguided men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aught in me but scoffing, sayest thou?&rdquo; retorted the Abbot of Unreason;
      &ldquo;why, reverend brother, I have all that becomes mine office at this time
      a-day&mdash;I have beef, ale, and brandy-wine, with other condiments not
      worth mentioning; and for speaking, man&mdash;why, speak away, and we will
      have turn about, like honest fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this discussion the wrath of Magdalen Graeme had risen to the
      uttermost; she approached the Abbot, and placing herself by his side, said
      in a low and yet distinct tone-&ldquo;Wake and arouse thee, Father&mdash;the
      sword of Saint Peter is in thy hand&mdash;strike and avenge Saint Peter's
      patrimony!&mdash;Bind them in the chains which, being riveted by the
      church on earth, are riveted in Heaven&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, sister!&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;let not their madness destroy our
      discretion&mdash;I pray thee, peace, and let me do mine office. It is the
      first, peradventure it may be the last time, I shall be called on to
      discharge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my holy brother!&rdquo; said Howleglas, &ldquo;I rede you, take the holy
      sister's advice&mdash;never throve convent without woman's counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, vain man!&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;and you, my brethren&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; said the Abbot of Unreason, &ldquo;no speaking to the lay people,
      until you have conferred with your brother of the cowl. I swear by bell,
      book, and candle, that no one of my congregation shall listen to one word
      you have to say; so you had as well address yourself to me who will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To escape a conference so ludicrous, the Abbot again attempted an appeal
      to what respectful feelings might yet remain amongst the inhabitants of
      the Halidome, once so devoted to their spiritual Superiors. Alas! the
      Abbot of Unreason had only to nourish his mock crosier, and the whooping,
      the hallooing, and the dancing, were renewed with a vehemence which would
      have defied the lungs of Stentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my mates,&rdquo; said the Abbot of Unreason, &ldquo;once again dight your
      gabs and be hushed-let us see if the Cock of Kennaquhair will fight or
      flee the pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was again a dead silence of expectation, of which Father Ambrose
      availed himself to address his antagonist, seeing plainly that he could
      gain an audience on no other terms. &ldquo;Wretched man!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;hast thou no
      better employment for thy carnal wit, than to employ it in leading these
      blind and helpless creatures into the pit of utter darkness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, my brother,&rdquo; replied Howleglas, &ldquo;I can see little difference
      betwixt your employment and mine, save that you make a sermon of a jest,
      and I make a jest of a sermon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy being,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;who hast no better subject of pleasantry
      than that which should make thee tremble&mdash;no sounder jest than thine
      own sins, and no better objects for laughter than those who can absolve
      thee from the guilt of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily, my reverend brother,&rdquo; said the mock Abbot, &ldquo;what you say might be
      true, if, in laughing at hypocrites, I meant to laugh at religion.&mdash;Oh,
      it is a precious thing to wear a long dress, with a girdle and a cowl&mdash;we
      become a holy pillar of Mother Church, and a boy must not play at ball
      against the walls for fear of breaking a painted window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you, my friends,&rdquo; said the Abbot, looking round and speaking
      with a vehemence which secured him a tranquil audience for some time,&mdash;&ldquo;will
      you suffer a profane buffoon, within the very church of God, to insult his
      ministers? Many of you&mdash;all of you, perhaps&mdash;have lived under my
      holy predecessors, who were called upon to rule in this church where I am
      called upon to suffer. If you have worldly goods, they are their gift;
      and, when you scorned not to accept better gifts&mdash;the mercy and
      forgiveness of the church&mdash;were they not ever at your command?&mdash;did
      we not pray while you were jovial&mdash;wake while you slept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the good wives of the Halidome were wont to say so,&rdquo; said the
      Abbot of Unreason; but his jest met in this instance but slight applause,
      and Father Ambrose, having gained a moment's attention, hastened to
      improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and is this grateful&mdash;is it seemly&mdash;is it
      honest&mdash;to assail with scorn a few old men, from whose predecessors
      you hold all, and whose only wish is to die in peace among these fragments
      of what was once the light of the land, and whose daily prayer is, that
      they may be removed ere that hour comes when the last spark shall be
      extinguished, and the land left in the darkness which it has chosen rather
      than light? We have not turned against you the edge of the spiritual
      sword, to revenge our temporal persecution; the tempest of your wrath hath
      despoiled us of land, and deprived us almost of our daily food, but we
      have not repaid it with the thunders of excommunication&mdash;we only pray
      your leave to live and die within the church which is our own, invoking
      God, our Lady, and the Holy Saints to pardon your sins, and our own,
      undisturbed by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, so different in tone and termination from that which the
      crowd had expected, produced an effect upon their feelings unfavourable to
      the prosecution of their frolic. The morris-dancers stood still&mdash;the
      hobby-horse surceased his capering&mdash;pipe and tabor were mute, and
      &ldquo;silence, like a heavy cloud,&rdquo; seemed to descend on the once noisy rabble.
      Several of the beasts were obviously moved to compunction; the bear could
      not restrain his sobs, and a huge fox was observed to wipe his eyes with
      his tail. But in especial the dragon, lately so formidably rampant, now
      relaxed the terror of his claws, uncoiled his tremendous rings, and
      grumbled out of his fiery throat in a repentant tone, &ldquo;By the mass, I
      thought no harm in exercising our old pastime, but an I had thought the
      good Father would have taken it so to heart, I would as soon have played
      your devil, as your dragon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this momentary pause, the Abbot stood amongst the miscellaneous and
      grotesque forms by which he was surrounded, triumphant as Saint Anthony,
      in Callot's Temptations; but Howleglas would not so resign his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how now, my masters!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is this fair play or no? Have you not
      chosen me Abbot of Unreason, and is it lawful for any of you to listen to
      common sense to-day? Was I not formally elected by you in solemn chapter,
      held in Luckie Martin's change-house, and will you now desert me, and give
      up your old pastime and privilege? Play out the play&mdash;and he that
      speaks the next word of sense or reason, or bids us think or consider, or
      the like of that, which befits not the day, I will have him solemnly
      ducked in the mill-dam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rabble, mutable as usual, huzzaed, the pipe and tabor struck up, the
      hobby-horse pranced, the beasts roared, and even the repentant dragon
      began again to coil up his spires, and prepare himself for fresh gambols.
      But the Abbot might still have overcome, by his eloquence and his
      entreaties, the malicious designs of the revellers, had not Dame Magdalen
      Graeme given loose to the indignation which she had long suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoffers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and men of Belial&mdash;Blasphemous heretics, and
      truculent tyrants&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your patience, my sister, I entreat and I command you!&rdquo; said the Abbot;
      &ldquo;let me do my duty&mdash;disturb me not in mine office!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dame Magdalen continued to thunder forth her threats in the name of
      Popes and Councils, and in the name of every Saint, from St. Michael
      downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My comrades!&rdquo; said the Abbot of Unreason, &ldquo;this good dame hath not spoken
      a single word of reason, and therein may esteem herself free from the law.
      But what she spoke was meant for reason, and, therefore, unless she
      confesses and avouches all which she has said to be nonsense, it shall
      pass for such, so far as to incur our statutes. Wherefore, holy dame,
      pilgrim, or abbess, or whatever thou art, be mute with thy mummery or
      beware the mill-dam. We will have neither spiritual nor temporal scolds in
      our Diocese of Unreason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke thus, he extended his hand towards the old woman, while his
      followers shouted, &ldquo;A doom&mdash;a doom!&rdquo; and prepared to second his
      purpose, when lo! it was suddenly frustrated. Roland Graeme had witnessed
      with indignation the insults offered to his old spiritual preceptor, but
      yet had wit enough to reflect he could render him no assistance, but might
      well, by ineffective interference, make matters worse. But when he saw his
      aged relative in danger of personal violence, he gave way to the natural
      impetuosity of his temper, and, stepping forward, struck his poniard into
      the body of the Abbot of Unreason, whom the blow instantly prostrated on
      the pavement.

      Chapter the Fifteenth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  As when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd,
  Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud,
  And stones and brands in rattling furies fly,
  And all the rustic arms which fury can supply&mdash;
  Then if some grave and pious man appear,
  They hush their noise, and lend a listening ear.
                                  DRYDEN'S VIRGIL
</pre>
    <p>
      A dreadful shout of vengeance was raised by the revellers, whose sport was
      thus so fearfully interrupted; but for an instant, the want of weapons
      amongst the multitude, as well as the inflamed features and brandished
      poniard of Roland Graeme, kept them at bay, while the Abbot, horror-struck
      at the violence, implored, with uplifted hands, pardon for blood-shed
      committed within the sanctuary. Magdalen Graeme alone expressed triumph in
      the blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer, mixed, however, with a
      wild and anxious expression of terror for her grandson's safety. &ldquo;Let him
      perish,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in his blasphemy&mdash;let him die on the holy
      pavement which he has insulted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the rage of the multitude, the grief of the Abbot, the exultation of
      the enthusiastic Magdalen, were all mistimed and unnecessary. Howleglas,
      mortally wounded as he was supposed to be, sprung alertly up from the
      floor, calling aloud, &ldquo;A miracle, a miracle, my masters! as brave a
      miracle as ever was wrought in the kirk of Kennaquhair. And I charge you,
      my masters, as your lawfully chosen Abbot, that you touch no one without
      my command&mdash;You, wolf and bear, will guard this pragmatic youth, but
      without hurting him&mdash;And you, reverend brother, will, with your
      comrades, withdraw to your cells; for our conference has ended like all
      conferences, leaving each of his own mind, as before; and if we fight,
      both you, and your brethren, and the Kirk, will have the worst on't&mdash;Wherefore,
      pack up you pipes and begone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hubbub was beginning again to awaken, but still Father Ambrose
      hesitated, as uncertain to what path his duty called him, whether to face
      out the present storm, or to reserve himself for a better moment. His
      brother of Unreason observed his difficulty, and said, in a tone more
      natural and less affected than that with which he had hitherto sustained
      his character, &ldquo;We came hither, my good sir, more in mirth than in
      mischief&mdash;our bark is worse than our bite&mdash;and, especially, we
      mean you no personal harm&mdash;wherefore, draw off while the play is
      good; for it is ill whistling for a hawk when she is once on the soar, and
      worse to snatch the quarry from the ban-dog&mdash;Let these fellows once
      begin their brawl, and it will be too much for madness itself, let alone
      the Abbot of Unreason, to bring them back to the lure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brethren crowded around Father Ambrosius, and joined in urging him to
      give place to the torrent. The present revel was, they said, an ancient
      custom which his predecessors had permitted, and old Father Nicholas
      himself had played the dragon in the days of the Abbot Ingelram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we now reap the fruit of the seed which they have so unadvisedly
      sown,&rdquo; said Ambrosius; &ldquo;they taught men to make a mock of what is holy,
      what wonder that the descendants of scoffers become robbers and
      plunderers? But be it as you list, my brethren&mdash;move towards the
      dortour&mdash;And you, dame, I command you, by the authority which I have
      over you, and by your respect for that youth's safety, that you go with us
      without farther speech&mdash;Yet, stay&mdash;what are your intentions
      towards that youth whom you detain prisoner?&mdash;Wot ye,&rdquo; he continued,
      addressing Howleglas in a stern tone of voice, &ldquo;that he bears the livery
      of the House of Avenel? They who fear not the anger of Heaven, may at
      least dread the wrath of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cumber not yourself concerning him,&rdquo; answered Howleglas, &ldquo;we know right
      well who and what he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pray,&rdquo; said the Abbot, in a tone of entreaty, &ldquo;that you do him no
      wrong for the rash deed&mdash;which he attempted in his imprudent zeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, cumber not yourself about it, father,&rdquo; answered Howleglas, &ldquo;but
      move off with your train, male and female, or I will not undertake to save
      yonder she-saint from the ducking-stool&mdash;And as for bearing of
      malice, my stomach has no room for it; it is,&rdquo; he added, clapping his hand
      on his portly belly, &ldquo;too well bumbasted out with straw and buckram&mdash;gramercy
      to them both&mdash;they kept out that madcap's dagger as well as a Milan
      corslet could have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the home-driven poniard of Roland Graeme had lighted upon the
      stuffing of the fictitious paunch, which the Abbot of Unreason wore as a
      part of his characteristic dress, and it was only the force of the blow
      which had prostrated that reverend person on the ground for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied in some degree by this man's assurances, and compelled&mdash;to
      give way to superior force, the Abbot Ambrosius retired from the Church at
      the head of the monks, and left the court free for the revellers to work
      their will. But, wild and wilful as these rioters were, they accompanied
      the retreat of the religionists with none of those shouts of contempt and
      derision with which they had at first hailed them. The Abbot's discourse
      had affected some of them with remorse, others with shame, and all with a
      transient degree of respect. They remained silent until the last monk had
      disappeared through the side-door which communicated with their
      dwelling-place, and even then it cost some exhortations on the part of
      Howleglas, some caprioles of the hobby-horse, and some wallops of the
      dragon, to rouse once more the rebuked spirit of revelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how now, my masters?&rdquo; said the Abbot of Unreason; &ldquo;and wherefore look
      on me with such blank Jack-a-Lent visages? Will you lose your old pastime
      for an old wife's tale of saints and purgatory? Why, I thought you would
      have made all split long since&mdash;Come, strike up, tabor and harp,
      strike up, fiddle and rebeck&mdash;dance and be merry to-day, and let care
      come to-morrow. Bear and wolf, look to your prisoner&mdash;prance, hobby&mdash;hiss,
      dragon, and halloo, boys&mdash;we grow older every moment we stand idle,
      and life is too short to be spent in playing mumchance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This pithy exhortation was attended with the effect desired. They
      fumigated the Church with burnt wool and feathers instead of incense, put
      foul water into the holy-water basins, and celebrated a parody on the
      Church-service, the mock Abbot officiating at the altar; they sung
      ludicrous and indecent parodies, to the tunes of church hymns; they
      violated whatever vestments or vessels belonging to the Abbey they could
      lay their hands upon; and, playing every freak which the whim of the
      moment could suggest to their wild caprice, at length they fell to more
      lasting deeds of demolition, pulled down and destroyed some carved
      wood-work, dashed out the painted windows which had escaped former
      violence, and in their rigorous search after sculpture dedicated to
      idolatry, began to destroy what ornaments yet remained entire upon the
      tombs, and around the cornices of the pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of demolition, like other tastes, increases by indulgence; from
      these lighter attempts at mischief, the more tumultuous part of the
      meeting began to meditate destruction on a more extended scale&mdash;&ldquo;Let
      us heave it down altogether, the old crow's nest,&rdquo; became a general cry
      among them; &ldquo;it has served the Pope and his rooks too long;&rdquo; and up they
      struck a ballad which was then popular among the lower classes. [Footnote:
      These rude rhymes are taken, with some trifling alterations, from a ballad
      called Trim-go-trix. It occurs in a singular collection, entitled; &ldquo;A
      Compendious Book of Godly and Spiritual Songs, collected out of sundrie
      parts of the Scripture, with sundry of other ballatis changed out of
      prophane sanges for avoyding of sin and harlotrie, with Augmentation of
      sundrie Gude and Godly Ballates. Edinburgh, printed by Andro Hart.&rdquo; This
      curious collection has been reprinted in Mr. John. Grahame Dalyell's
      Scottish Poems of the 16th century Edin. 1801, 2 vols.]

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Paip, that pagan full of pride,
  Hath blinded us ower lang.
  For where the blind the blind doth lead,
  No marvel baith gae wrang.
  Like prince and king,
  He led the ring
  Of all iniquity.
  Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix,
  Under the greenwood tree.

  &ldquo;The Bishop rich, he could not preach
  For sporting with the lasses;
  The silly friar behoved to fleech
  For awmous as he passes:
  The curate his creed
  He could not read,&mdash;
  Shame fa' company!
  Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix,
  Under the greenwood tree.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thundering out this chorus of a notable hunting song, which had been
      pressed into the service of some polemical poet, the followers of the
      Abbot of Unreason were turning every moment more tumultuous, and getting
      beyond the management even of that reverend prelate himself, when a knight
      in full armour, followed by two or three men-at-arms, entered the church,
      and in a stern voice commanded them to forbear their riotous mummery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visor was up, but if it had been lowered, the cognizance of the
      holly-branch sufficiently distinguished Sir Halbert Glendinning, who, on
      his homeward road, was passing through the village of Kennaquhair; and
      moved, perhaps, by anxiety for his brother's safety, had come directly to
      the church on hearing of the uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my masters? are ye Christian men,
      and the king's subjects, and yet waste and destroy church and chancel like
      so many heathens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All stood silent, though doubtless there were several disappointed and
      surprised at receiving chiding instead of thanks from so zealous a
      protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dragon, indeed, did at length take upon him to be spokesman, and
      growled from the depth of his painted maw, that they did but sweep Popery
      out of the church with the besom of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my friends,&rdquo; replied Sir Halbert Glendinning, &ldquo;think you this
      mumming and masking has not more of Popery in it than have these stone
      walls? Take the leprosy out of your flesh, before you speak of purifying
      stone walls&mdash;abate your insolent license, which leads but to idle
      vanity and sinful excess; and know, that what you now practise, is one of
      the profane and unseemly sports introduced by the priests of Rome
      themselves, to mislead and to brutify the souls which fell into their
      net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry come up&mdash;are you there with your bears?&rdquo; muttered the dragon,
      with a draconic sullenness, which was in good keeping with his character,
      &ldquo;we had as good have been Romans still, if we are to have no freedom in
      our pastimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou reply to me so?&rdquo; said Halbert Glendinning; &ldquo;or is there any
      pastime in grovelling on the ground there like a gigantic kail-worm?&mdash;Get
      out of thy painted case, or, by my knighthood, I will treat you like the
      beast and reptile you have made yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast and reptile?&rdquo; retorted the offended dragon, &ldquo;setting aside your
      knighthood, I hold myself as well a born man as thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight made no answer in words, but bestowed two such blows with the
      butt of his lance on the petulant dragon, that had not the hoops which
      constituted the ribs of the machine been pretty strong, they would hardly
      have saved those of the actor from being broken. In all haste the masker
      crept out of his disguise, unwilling to abide a third buffet from the
      lance of the enraged Knight. And when the ex-dragon stood on the floor of
      the church, he presented to Halbert Glendinning the well-known countenance
      of Dan of the Howlet-hirst, an ancient comrade of his own, ere fate had
      raised him so high above the rank to which he was born. The clown looked
      sulkily upon the Knight, as if to upbraid him for his violence towards an
      old acquaintance, and Glendinning's own good-nature reproached him for the
      violence he had acted upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did wrong to strike thee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Dan; but in truth, I knew thee not&mdash;thou
      wert ever a mad fellow&mdash;come to Avenel Castle, and we shall see how
      my hawks fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we show him not falcons that will mount as merrily as rockets,&rdquo;
       said the Abbot of Unreason, &ldquo;I would your honour laid as hard on my bones
      as you did on his even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Sir Knave,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;and what has brought you hither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot, hastily ridding himself of the false nose which mystified his
      physiognomy, and the supplementary belly which made up his disguise, stood
      before his master in his real character, of Adam Woodcock, the falconer of
      Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, varlet!&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;hast thou dared to come here and disturb
      the very house my brother was dwelling in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was even for that reason, craving your honour's pardon, that I
      came hither&mdash;for I heard the country was to be up to choose an Abbot
      of Unreason, and sure, thought I, I that can sing, dance, leap backwards
      over a broadsword, and am as good a fool as ever sought promotion, have
      all chance of carrying the office; and if I gain my election, I may stand
      his honour's brother in some stead, supposing things fall roughly out at
      the Kirk of Saint Mary's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art but a cogging knave,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, &ldquo;and well I wot, that
      love of ale and brandy, besides the humour of riot and frolic, would draw
      thee a mile, when love of my house would not bring thee a yard. But, go to&mdash;carry
      thy roisterers elsewhere&mdash;to the alehouse if they list, and there are
      crowns to pay your charges&mdash;make out the day's madness without doing
      more mischief, and be wise men to-morrow&mdash;and hereafter learn to
      serve a good cause better than by acting like buffoons or ruffians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to his master's mandate, the falconer was collecting his
      discouraged followers, and whispering into their ears&mdash;&ldquo;Away, away&mdash;<i>tace</i>
      is Latin for a candle&mdash;never mind the good Knight's puritanism&mdash;we
      will play the frolic out over a stand of double ale in Dame Martin the
      Brewster's barn-yard&mdash;draw off, harp and tabor&mdash;bagpipe and drum&mdash;mum
      till you are out of the church-yard, then let the welkin ring again&mdash;move
      on, wolf and bear&mdash;keep the hind legs till you cross the kirk-stile,
      and then show yourselves beasts of mettle&mdash;what devil sent him here
      to spoil our holiday!&mdash;but anger him not, my hearts; his lance is no
      goose-feather, as Dan's ribs can tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my soul,&rdquo; said Dan, &ldquo;had it been another than my ancient comrade, I
      would have made my father's old fox [Footnote: <i>Fox</i>, An
      old-fashioned broadsword was often so called.] fly about his ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! man,&rdquo; replied Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;not a word that way, as you
      value the safety of your bones&mdash;what man? we must take a clink as it
      passes, so it is not bestowed in downright ill-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will take no such thing,&rdquo; said Dan of the Howlet-hirst, suddenly
      resisting the efforts of Woodcock, who was dragging him out of the church;
      when the quick military eye of Sir Halbert Glendinning detecting Roland
      Graeme betwixt his two guards, the Knight exclaimed, &ldquo;So ho! falconer,&mdash;Woodcock,&mdash;knave,
      hast thou brought my Lady's page in mine own livery, to assist at this
      hopeful revel of thine, with your wolves and bears? Since you were at such
      mummings, you might, if you would, have at least saved the credit of my
      household, by dressing him up as a jackanapes&mdash;bring him hither,
      fellows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adam Woodcock was too honest and downright, to permit blame to light upon
      the youth, when it was undeserved. &ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by Saint Martin of
      Bullions&mdash;&rdquo; [Footnote: The Saint Swithin, or weeping Saint of
      Scotland. If his festival (fourth July) prove wet, forty days of rain are
      expected.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what hast thou to do with Saint Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, little enough, sir, unless when he sends such rainy days that we
      cannot fly a hawk&mdash;but I say to your worshipful knighthood, that as I
      am, a true man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are a false varlet, had been the better obtestation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, if your knighthood allows me not to speak,&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;I can hold
      my tongue&mdash;but the boy came not hither by my bidding, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to gratify his own malapert pleasure, I warrant me,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert
      Glendinning&mdash;&ldquo;Come hither, young springald, and tell me whether you
      have your mistress's license to be so far absent from the castle, or to
      dishonour my livery by mingling in such a May-game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Halbert Glendinning,&rdquo; answered Roland Graeme with steadiness, &ldquo;I have
      obtained the permission, or rather the commands, of your lady, to dispose
      of my time hereafter according to my own pleasure. I have been a most
      unwilling spectator of this May-game, since it is your pleasure so to call
      it; and I only wear your livery until I can obtain clothes which bear no
      such badge of servitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to understand this, young man?&rdquo; said Sir Halbert Glendinning;
      &ldquo;speak plainly, for I am no reader of riddles.&mdash;That my lady favoured
      thee, I know. What hast thou done to disoblige her, and occasion thy
      dismissal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to speak of,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, answering for the boy&mdash;&ldquo;a
      foolish quarrel with me, which was more foolishly told over again to my
      honoured lady, cost the poor boy his place. For my part, I will say
      freely, that I was wrong from beginning to end, except about the washing
      of the eyas's meat. There I stand to it that I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, the good-natured falconer repeated to his master the whole
      history of the squabble which had brought Roland Graeme into disgrace with
      his mistress, but in a manner so favourable for the page, that Sir Halbert
      could not but suspect his generous motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a good-natured fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Adam Woodcock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As ever had falcon upon fist,&rdquo; said Adam; &ldquo;and, for that matter, so is
      Master Roland; but, being half a gentleman by his office, his blood is
      soon up, and so is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, &ldquo;be it as it will, my lady has acted hastily,
      for this was no great matter of offence to discard the lad whom she had
      trained up for years; but he, I doubt not, made it worse by his prating&mdash;it
      jumps well with a purpose, however, which I had in my mind. Draw off these
      people, Woodcock,&mdash;and you, Roland Graeme, attend me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page followed him in silence into the Abbot's house, where, stepping
      into the first apartment which he found open, he commanded one of his
      attendants to let his brother, Master Edward Glendinning, know that he
      desired to speak with him. The men-at-arms went gladly off to join their
      comrade, Adam Woodcock, and the jolly crew whom he had assembled at Dame
      Martin's, the hostler's wife, and the Page and Knight were left alone in
      the apartment. Sir Halbert Glendinning paced the floor for a moment in
      silence and then thus addressed his attendant&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou mayest have remarked, stripling, that I have but seldom
      distinguished thee by much notice;&mdash;I see thy colour rises, but do
      not speak till thou nearest me out. I say I have never much distinguished
      thee, not because I did not see that in thee which I might well have
      praised, but because I saw something blameable, which such praises might
      have made worse. Thy mistress, dealing according to her pleasure in her
      own household, as no one had better reason or title, had picked thee from
      the rest, and treated thee more like a relation than a domestic; and if
      thou didst show some vanity and petulance under such distinction, it were
      injustice not to say that thou hast profited both in thy exercises and in
      thy breeding, and hast shown many sparkles of a gentle and manly spirit.
      Moreover, it were ungenerous, having bred thee up freakish and fiery, to
      dismiss thee to want or wandering, for showing that very peevishness and
      impatience of discipline which arose from thy too delicate nurture.
      Therefore, and for the credit of my own household, I am determined to
      retain thee in my train, until I can honourably dispose of thee elsewhere,
      with a fair prospect of thy going through the world with credit to the
      house that brought thee up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there was something in Sir Halbert Glendinning's speech which flattered
      Roland's pride, there was also much that, according to his mode of
      thinking, was an alloy to the compliment. And yet his conscience instantly
      told him that he ought to accept, with grateful deference, the offer which
      was made him by the husband of his kind protectress; and his prudence,
      however slender, could not but admit he should enter the world under very
      different auspices as a retainer of Sir Halbert Glendinning, so famed for
      wisdom, courage, and influence, from those under which he might partake
      the wanderings, and become an agent in the visionary schemes, for such
      they appeared to him, of Magdalen, his relative. Still, a strong
      reluctance to re-enter a service from which he had been dismissed with
      contempt, almost counterbalanced these considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Halbert looked on the youth with surprise, and resumed&mdash;&ldquo;You seem
      to hesitate, young man. Are your own prospects so inviting, that you
      should pause ere you accept those which I should offer to you? or, must I
      remind you that, although you have offended your benefactress, even to the
      point of her dismissing you, yet I am convinced, the knowledge that you
      have gone unguided on your own wild way, into a world so disturbed as ours
      of Scotland, cannot, in the upshot, but give her sorrow and pain; from
      which it is, in gratitude, your duty to preserve her, no less than it is
      in common wisdom your duty to accept my offered protection, for your own
      sake, where body and soul are alike endangered, should you refuse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme replied in a respectful tone, but at the same time with some
      spirit, &ldquo;I am not ungrateful for such countenance as has been afforded me
      by the Lord of Avenel, and I am glad to learn, for the first time, that I
      have not had the misfortune to be utterly beneath his observation, as I
      had thought&mdash;And it is only needful to show me how I can testify my
      duty and my gratitude towards my early and constant benefactress with my
      life's hazard, and I will gladly peril it.&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are but words, young man,&rdquo; answered Glendinning, &ldquo;large
      protestations are often used to supply the place of effectual service. I
      know nothing in which the peril of your life can serve the Lady of Avenel;
      I can only say, she will be pleased to learn you have adopted some course
      which may ensure the safety of your person, and the weal of your soul&mdash;What
      ails you, that you accept not that safety when it is offered you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only relative who is alive,&rdquo; answered Roland, &ldquo;at least the only
      relative whom I have ever seen, has rejoined me since I was dismissed from
      the Castle of Avenel, and I must consult with her whether I can adopt the
      line to which you now call me, or whether her increasing infirmities, or
      the authority which she is entitled to exercise over me, may not require
      me to abide with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this relation?&rdquo; said Sir Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this house,&rdquo; answered the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go then, and seek her out,&rdquo; said the Knight of Avenel; &ldquo;more than meet it
      is that thou shouldst have her approbation, yet worse than foolish would
      she show herself in denying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland left the apartment to seek for his grandmother; and, as he
      retreated, the Abbot entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers met as brothers who loved each other fondly, yet meet
      rarely together. Such indeed was the case. Their mutual affection attached
      them to each other; but in every pursuit, habit or sentiment, connected
      with the discords of the times, the friend and counsellor of Murray stood
      opposed to the Roman Catholic priest; nor, indeed, could they have held
      very much society together, without giving cause of offence and suspicion
      to their confederates on each side. After a close embrace on the part of
      both, and a welcome on that of the Abbot, Sir Halbert Glendinning
      expressed his satisfaction that he had come in time to appease the riot
      raised by Howleglas and his tumultuous followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I look on your garments, brother Edward, I
      cannot help thinking there still remains an Abbot of Unreason within the
      bounds of the Monastery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore carp at my garments, brother Halbert?&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;it
      is the spiritual armour of my calling, and, as such, beseems me as well as
      breastplate and baldric becomes your own bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but there were small wisdom, methinks, in putting on armour where we
      have no power to fight; it is but a dangerous temerity to defy the foe
      whom we cannot resist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that, my brother, no one can answer,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;until the
      battle be fought; and, were it even as you say, methinks a brave man,
      though desperate of victory, would rather desire to fight and fall, than
      to resign sword and shield on some mean and dishonourable composition with
      his insulting antagonist. But, let not you and I make discord of a theme
      on which we cannot agree, but rather stay and partake, though a heretic,
      of my admission feast. You need not fear, my brother, that your zeal for
      restoring the primitive discipline of the church will, on this occasion,
      be offended with the rich profusion of a conventual banquet. The days of
      our old friend Abbot Boniface are over; and the Superior of Saint Mary's
      has neither forests nor fishings, woods nor pastures, nor corn-fields;&mdash;neither
      flocks nor herds, bucks nor wild-fowl&mdash;granaries of wheat, nor
      storehouses of oil and wine, of ale and of mead. The refectioner's office
      is ended; and such a meal as a hermit in romance can offer to a wandering
      knight, is all we have to set before you. But, if you will share it with
      us, we shall eat it with a cheerful heart, and thank you, my brother, for
      your timely protection against these rude scoffers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest brother,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;it grieves me deeply I cannot
      abide with you; but it would sound ill for us both were one of the
      reformed congregation to sit down at your admission feast; and, if I can
      ever have the satisfaction of affording you effectual protection, it will
      be much owing to my remaining unsuspected of countenancing or approving
      your religious rites and ceremonies. It will demand whatever consideration
      I can acquire among my own friends, to shelter the bold man, who, contrary
      to law and the edicts of parliament, has dared to take up the office of
      Abbot of Saint Mary's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble not yourself with the task, my brother,&rdquo; replied Father
      Ambrosius. &ldquo;I would lay down my dearest blood to know that you defended
      the church for the church's sake; but, while you remain unhappily her
      enemy, I would not that you endangered your own safety, or diminished your
      own comforts, for the sake of my individual protection.&mdash;But who
      comes hither to disturb the few minutes of fraternal communication which
      our evil fate allows us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the apartment opened as the Abbot spoke, and Dame Magdalen
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this woman?&rdquo; said Sir Halbert Glendinning, somewhat sternly, &ldquo;and
      what does she want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you know me not,&rdquo; said the matron, &ldquo;signifies little; I come by your
      own order, to give my free consent that the stripling, Roland Graeme,
      return to your service; and, having said so, I cumber you no longer with
      my presence. Peace be with you!&rdquo; She turned to go away, but was stopped by
      inquiries of Sir Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&mdash;what are you?&mdash;and why do you not await to make
      me answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;while yet I belonged to the world, a matron of no
      vulgar name; now I am Magdalen, a poor pilgrimer, for the sake of Holy
      Kirk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, &ldquo;art thou a Catholic? I thought my dame said that
      Roland Graeme came of reformed kin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father,&rdquo; said the matron, &ldquo;was a heretic, or rather one who regarded
      neither orthodoxy or heresy&mdash;neither the temple of the church or of
      antichrist. I, too, for the sins of the times make sinners, have seemed to
      conform to your unhallowed rites&mdash;but I had my dispensation and my
      absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, brother,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, with a smile of meaning towards his
      brother, &ldquo;that we accuse you not altogether without grounds of mental
      equivocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, you do us injustice,&rdquo; replied the Abbot; &ldquo;this woman, as her
      bearing may of itself warrant you, is not in her perfect mind. Thanks, I
      must needs say, to the persecution of your marauding barons, and of your
      latitudinarian clergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not dispute the point,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert; &ldquo;the evils of the time
      are unhappily so numerous, that both churches may divide them, and have
      enow to spare.&rdquo; So saying, he leaned from the window of the apartment, and
      winded his bugle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you sound your horn, my brother?&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;we have spent
      but few minutes together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the elder brother, &ldquo;and even these few have been sullied by
      disagreement. I sound to horse, my brother&mdash;the rather that, to avert
      the consequences of this day's rashness on your part, requires hasty
      efforts on mine.&mdash;Dame, you will oblige me by letting your young
      relative know that we mount instantly. I intend not that he shall return
      to Avenel with me&mdash;it would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and my
      household; at least to taunts which his proud heart could ill brook, and
      my wish is to do him kindness. He shall, therefore, go forward to
      Edinburgh with one of my retinue, whom I shall send back to say what has
      chanced here.&mdash;You seem rejoiced at this?&rdquo; he added, fixing his eyes
      keenly on Magdalen Graeme, who returned his gaze with calm indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that Roland, a poor and friendless orphan,
      were the jest of the world at large, than of the menials at Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not, dame&mdash;he shall be scorned by neither,&rdquo; answered the
      Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;&ldquo;it may well be&mdash;but I will trust more
      to his own bearing than to your countenance.&rdquo; She left the room as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight looked after her as she departed, but turned instantly to his
      brother, and expressing, in the most affectionate terms, his wishes for
      his welfare and happiness, craved his leave to depart. &ldquo;My knaves,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;are too busy at the ale-stand, to leave their revelry for the empty
      breath of a bugle-horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have freed them from higher restraint, Halbert,&rdquo; answered the Abbot,
      &ldquo;and therein taught them to rebel against your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not that, Edward,&rdquo; exclaimed Halbert, who never gave his brother his
      monastic name of Ambrosius; &ldquo;none obey the command of real duty so well as
      those who are free from the observance of slavish bondage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was turning to depart, when the Abbot said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us not yet part,
      my brother&mdash;here comes some light refreshment. Leave not the house
      which I must now call mine, till force expel me from it, until you have at
      least broken bread with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lay brother, the same who acted as porter, now entered the
      apartment, bearing some simple refreshment, and a flask of wine. &ldquo;He had
      found it,&rdquo; he said with officious humility, &ldquo;by rummaging through every
      nook of the cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight filled a small silver cup, and, quaffing it off, asked his
      brother to pledge him, observing, the wine was Bacharac, of the first
      vintage, and great age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the poor lay brother, &ldquo;it came out of the nook which old
      brother Nicholas, (may his soul be happy!) was wont to call Abbot
      Ingelram's corner; and Abbot Ingelram was bred at the Convent of
      Wurtzburg, which I understand to be near where that choice wine grows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, my reverend sir,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert; &ldquo;and therefore I entreat my
      brother and you to pledge me in a cup of this orthodox vintage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thin old porter looked with a wishful glance towards the Abbot. &ldquo;<i>Do
      veniam</i>,&rdquo; said his Superior; and the old man seized, with a trembling
      hand, a beverage to which he had been long unaccustomed; drained the cup
      with protracted delight, as if dwelling on the flavour and perfume, and
      set it down with a melancholy smile and shake of the head, as if bidding
      adieu in future to such delicious potations. The brothers smiled. But when
      Sir Halbert motioned to the Abbot to take up his cup and do him reason,
      the Abbot, in turn, shook his head, and replied&mdash;&ldquo;This is no day for
      the Abbot of Saint Mary's to eat the fat and drink the sweat. In water
      from our Lady's well,&rdquo; he added, filling a cup with the limpid element, &ldquo;I
      wish you, brother, all happiness, and above all, a true sight of your
      spiritual errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to you, my beloved Edward,&rdquo; replied Glendinning, &ldquo;I wish the free
      exercise of your own free reason, and the discharge of more important
      duties than are connected with the idle name which you have so rashly
      assumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers parted with deep regret; and yet, each confident in his
      opinion, felt somewhat relieved by the absence of one whom he respected so
      much, and with whom he could agree so little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards the sound of the Knight of Avenel's trumpets was heard,
      and the Abbot went to the top of the tower, from whose dismantled
      battlements he could soon see the horsemen ascending the rising ground in
      the direction of the drawbridge. As he gazed, Magdalen Graeme came to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to catch the last glimpse of thy grandson, my
      sister. Yonder he wends, under the charge of the best knight in Scotland,
      his faith ever excepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst bear witness, my father, that it was no wish either of mine or
      of Roland's,&rdquo; replied the matron, &ldquo;which induced the Knight of Avenel, as
      he is called, again to entertain my grandson in his household&mdash;Heaven,
      which confounds the wise with their own wisdom, and the wicked with their
      own policy, hath placed him where, for the services of the Church, I would
      most wish him to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not what you mean, my sister,&rdquo; said the Abbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; replied Magdalen, &ldquo;hast thou never heard that there are
      spirits powerful to rend the walls of a castle asunder when once admitted,
      which yet cannot enter the house unless they are invited, nay, dragged
      over the threshold?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: There is a popular belief respecting evil spirits, that they
      cannot enter an inhabited house unless invited, nay, dragged over the
      threshold. There is an instance of the same superstition in the Tales of
      the Genii, where an enchanter is supposed to have intruded himself into
      the Divan of the Sultan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thus,' said the illustrious Misnar, 'let the enemies of Mahomet be
      dismayed! but inform me, O ye sages! under the semblance of which of your
      brethren did that foul enchanter gain admittance here?'&mdash;'May the
      lord of my heart,' answered Balihu, the hermit of the faithful from Queda,
      'triumph over all his foes! As I travelled on the mountains from Queda,
      and saw neither the footsteps of beasts, nor the flight of birds, behold,
      I chanced to pass through a cavern, in whose hollow sides I found this
      accursed sage, to whom I unfolded the invitation of the Sultan of India,
      and we, joining, journeyed towards the Divan; but ere we entered, he said
      unto me. 'Put thy hand forth, and pull me towards thee into the Divan,
      calling on the name of Mahomet, for the evil spirits are on me and vex
      me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have understood that many parts of these fine tales, and in particular
      that of the Sultan Misnar, were taken from genuine Oriental sources by the
      editor, Mr. James Ridley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most picturesque use of this popular belief occurs in Coleridge's
      beautiful and tantalizing fragment of Christabel. Has not our own
      imaginative poet cause to fear that future ages will desire to summon him
      from his place of rest, as Milton longed
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To call him up, who left half told
   The story of Cambuscan bold?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The verses I refer to are when Christabel conducts into her father's
      castle a mysterious and malevolent being, under the guise of a distressed
      female stranger.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'They cross'd the moat, and Christabel
  Took the key that fitted well;
  A little door she open'd straight,
  All in the middle of the gate;
  The gate that was iron'd within and without,
  Where an army in battle array had march'd out.

  &ldquo;The lady sank, belike through pain,
  And Christabel with might and main
  Lifted her up, a weary weight,
  Over the threshold of the gate:
  Then the lady rose again,
  And moved as she were not in pain.

  &ldquo;So free from danger, free from fear,
  They cross'd the court;&mdash;right glad they were,
  And Christabel devoutly cried
  To the lady by her side:
  'Praise we the Virgin, all divine,
    Who hath rescued thee from this distress.'
  'Alas, alas!' said Geraldine,
  'I cannot speak from weariness.'
  So free from danger, free from fear,
  They cross'd the court: right glad they were
]

    <p>
      Twice hath Roland Graeme been thus drawn into the household of Avenel by
      those who now hold the title. Let them look to the issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying she left the turret; and the Abbot, after pausing a moment on
      her words, which he imputed to the unsettled state of her mind, followed
      down the winding stair to celebrate his admission to his high office by
      fast and prayer instead of revelling and thanksgiving.

  Youth! thou wear'st to manhood now,
  Darker lip and darker brow,
  Statelier step, more pensive mien,
  In thy face and gate are seen:
  Thou must now brook midnight watches,
  Take thy food and sport by snatches;
  For the gambol and the jest,

    <p>
      Young Roland Graeme now trotted gaily forward in the train of Sir Halbert
      Glendinning. He was relieved from his most galling apprehension,&mdash;the
      encounter of the scorn and taunt which might possibly hail his immediate
      return to the Castle of Avenel. &ldquo;There will be a change ere they see me
      again,&rdquo; he thought to himself; &ldquo;I shall wear the coat of plate, instead of
      the green jerkin, and the steel morion for the bonnet and feather. They
      will be bold that may venture to break a gibe on the man-at-arms for the
      follies of the page; and I trust, that ere we return I shall have done
      something more worthy of note than hallooing a hound after a deer, or
      scrambling a crag for a kite's nest.&rdquo; He could not, indeed, help
      marvelling that his grandmother, with all her religious prejudices,
      leaning, it would seem, to the other side, had consented so readily to his
      re-entering the service of the House of Avenel; and yet more, at the
      mysterious joy with which she took leave of him at the Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; said the dame, as she kissed her young relation, and bade him
      farewell, &ldquo;works its own work, even by the hands of those of our enemies
      who think themselves the strongest and the wisest. Thou, my child, be
      ready to act upon the call of thy religion and country; and remember, each
      earthly bond which thou canst form is, compared to the ties which bind
      thee to them, like the loose flax to the twisted cable. Thou hast not
      forgot the face or form of the damsel Catherine Seyton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland would have replied in the negative, but the word seemed to stick in
      his throat and Magdalen continued her exhortations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must not forget her, my son; and here I intrust thee with a token,
      which I trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity of delivering with
      care and secrecy into her own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put here into Roland's hand a very small packet, of which she again
      enjoined him to take the strictest care, and to suffer it to be seen by no
      one save Catherine Seyton, who, she again (very unnecessarily) reminded
      him, was the young lady he had met on the preceding day. She then bestowed
      on him her solemn benediction, and bade God speed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in her manner and her conduct which implied mystery;
      but Roland Graeme was not of an age or temper to waste much time in
      endeavoring to decipher her meaning. All that was obvious to his
      perception in the present journey, promised pleasure and novelty. He
      rejoiced that he was travelling towards Edinburgh, in order to assume the
      character of a man, and lay aside that of a boy. He was delighted to think
      that he would have an opportunity of rejoining Catherine Seyton, whose
      bright eyes and lively manners had made so favourable an impression on his
      imagination; and, as an experienced, yet high-spirited youth, entering for
      the first time upon active life, his heart bounded at the thought, that he
      was about to see all those scenes of courtly splendour and warlike
      adventures, of which the followers of Sir Halbert used to boast on their
      occasional visits to Avenel, to the wonderment and envy of those who, like
      Roland, knew courts and camps only by hearsay, and were condemned to the
      solitary sports and almost monastic seclusion of Avenel, surrounded by its
      lonely lake, and embossed among its pathless mountains. &ldquo;They shall
      mention my name,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;if the risk of my life can purchase
      me opportunities of distinction, and Catherine Seyton's saucy eye shall
      rest with more respect on the distinguished soldier, than that with which
      she laughed to scorn the raw and inexperienced page.&rdquo;&mdash;There was
      wanting but one accessary to complete the sense of rapturous excitation,
      and he possessed it by being once more mounted on the back of a fiery and
      active horse, instead of plodding along on foot, as had been the case
      during the preceding days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impelled by the liveliness of his own spirits, which so many circumstances
      tended naturally to exalt, Roland Graeme's voice and his laughter were
      soon distinguished amid the trampling of the horses of the retinue, and
      more than once attracted the attention of the leader, who remarked with
      satisfaction, that the youth replied with good-humoured raillery to such
      of the train as jested with him on his dismissal and return to the service
      of the House of Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the holly-branch in your bonnet had been blighted, Master
      Roland?&rdquo; said one of the men-at-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only pinched with half an hour's frost; you see it flourishes as green as
      ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too grave a plant to flourish on so hot a soil as that headpiece of
      thine, Master Roland Graeme,&rdquo; retorted the other, who was an old equerry
      of Sir Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it will not flourish alone,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;I will mix it with the
      laurel and the myrtle&mdash;and I will carry them so near the sky, that it
      shall make amends for their stinted growth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, he dashed his spurs into his horse's sides, and, checking
      him at the same time, compelled him to execute a lofty caracole. Sir
      Halbert Glendinning looked at the demeanour of his new attendant with that
      sort of melancholy pleasure with which those who have long followed the
      pursuits of life, and are sensible of their vanity, regard the gay, young,
      and buoyant spirits to whom existence, as yet, is only hope and promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Adam Woodcock, the falconer, stripped of his masquing
      habit, and attired, according to his rank and calling, in a green jerkin,
      with a hawking-bag on the one side, and a short hanger on the other, a
      glove on his left hand which reached half way up his arm, and a bonnet and
      feather upon his head, came after the party as fast as his active little
      galloway-nag could trot, and immediately entered into parley with Roland
      Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my youngster, you are once more under shadow of the holly-branch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in case to repay you, my good friend,&rdquo; answered Roland, &ldquo;your ten
      groats of silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, but an hour since,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;you had nearly paid me
      with ten inches of steel. On my faith, it is written in the book of our
      destiny, that I must brook your dagger after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, speak not of that, my good friend,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;I would rather
      have broached my own bosom than yours; but who could have known you in the
      mumming dress you wore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the falconer resumed,&mdash;for both as a poet and actor he had his
      own professional share of self-conceit,&mdash;&ldquo;I think I was as good a
      Howleglas as ever played part at a Shrovetide revelry, and not a much
      worse Abbot of Unreason. I defy the Old Enemy to unmask me when I choose
      to keep my vizard on. What the devil brought the Knight on us before we
      had the game out? You would have heard me hollo my own new ballad with a
      voice should have reached to Berwick. But I pray you, Master Roland, be
      less free of cold steel on slight occasions; since, but for the stuffing
      of my reverend doublet, I had only left the kirk to take my place in the
      kirkyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, spare me that feud,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;we shall have no time to
      fight it out; for, by our lord's command, I am bound for Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;and even therefore we shall have time to
      solder up this rent by the way, for Sir Halbert has appointed me your
      companion and guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? and with what purpose?&rdquo; said the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;is a question I cannot answer; but I know,
      that be the food of the eyases washed or unwashed, and, indeed, whatever
      becomes of perch and mew, I am to go with you to Edinburgh, and see you
      safely delivered to the Regent at Holyrood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, to the Regent?&rdquo; said Roland, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, by my faith, to the Regent,&rdquo; replied Woodcock; &ldquo;I promise you, that
      if you are not to enter his service, at least you are to wait upon him in
      the character of a retainer of our Knight of Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no right,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;which the Knight of Avenel hath to
      transfer my service, supposing that I owe it to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;that is a question I advise no one to
      stir in until he has the mountain or the lake, or the march of another
      kingdom, which is better than either, betwixt him and his feudal
      superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Sir Halbert Glendinning,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;is not my feudal superior;
      nor has he aught of authority&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, my son, to rein your tongue,&rdquo; answered Adam Woodcock; &ldquo;my
      lord's displeasure, if you provoke it, will be worse to appease than my
      lady's. The touch of his least finger were heavier than her hardest blow.
      And, by my faith, he is a man of steel, as true and as pure, but as hard
      and as pitiless. You remember the Cock of Capperlaw, whom he hanged over
      his gate for a mere mistake&mdash;a poor yoke of oxen taken in Scotland,
      when he thought he was taking them in English land? I loved the Cock of
      Capperlaw; the Kerrs had not an honester man in their clan, and they have
      had men that might have been a pattern to the Border&mdash;men that would
      not have lifted under twenty cows at once, and would have held themselves
      dishonoured if they had taken a drift of sheep, or the like, but always
      managed their raids in full credit and honour.&mdash;But see, his worship
      halts, and we are close by the bridge. Ride up&mdash;ride up&mdash;we must
      have his last instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as Adam Woodcock said. In the hollow way descending towards the
      bridge, which was still in the guardianship of Peter Bridgeward, as he was
      called, though he was now very old, Sir Halbert Glendinning halted his
      retinue, and beckoned to Woodcock and Graeme to advance to the head of the
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woodcock,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou knowest to whom thou art to conduct this youth.
      And thou, young man, obey discreetly and with diligence the orders that
      shall be given thee. Curb thy vain and peevish temper. Be just, true, and
      faithful; and there is in thee that which may raise thee many a degree
      above thy present station. Neither shalt thou&mdash;always supposing thine
      efforts to be fair and honest&mdash;want the protection and countenance of
      Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving them in front of the bridge, the centre tower of which now began
      to cast a prolonged shade upon the river, the Knight of Avenel turned to
      the left, without crossing the river, and pursued his way towards the
      chain of hills within whose recesses are situated the Lake and Castle of
      Avenel. There remained behind, the falconer, Roland Graeme, and a domestic
      of the Knight, of inferior rank, who was left with them to look after
      their horses while on the road, to carry their baggage, and to attend to
      their convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as the more numerous body of riders had turned off to pursue their
      journey westward, those whose route lay across the river, and was directed
      towards the north, summoned the Bridgeward, and demanded a free passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not lower the bridge,&rdquo; answered Peter, in a voice querulous with
      age and ill-humour.&mdash;&ldquo;Come Papist, come Protestant, ye are all the
      same. The Papist threatened us with Purgatory, and fleeched us with
      pardons&mdash;the Protestant mints at us with his sword, and cuttles us
      with the liberty of conscience; but never a one of either says, 'Peter,
      there is your penny.' I am well tired of all this, and for no man shall
      the bridge fall that pays me not ready money; and I would have you know I
      care as little for Geneva as for Rome&mdash;as little for homilies as for
      pardons; and the silver pennies are the only passports I will hear of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a proper old chuff!&rdquo; said Woodcock to his companion; then raising
      his voice, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Hark thee, dog&mdash;Bridgeward, villain, dost
      thou think we have refused thy namesake Peter's pence to Rome, to pay
      thine at the bridge of Kennaquhair? Let thy bridge down instantly to the
      followers of the house of Avenel, or by the hand of my father, and that
      handled many a bridle rein, for he was a bluff Yorkshireman&mdash;I say,
      by my father's hand, our Knight will blow thee out of thy solan-goose's
      nest there in the middle of the water, with the light falconet which we
      are bringing southward from Edinburgh to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bridgeward heard, and muttered, &ldquo;A plague on falcon and falconet, on
      cannon and demicannon, and all the barking bull-dogs whom they halloo
      against stone and lime in these our days! It was a merry time when there
      was little besides handy blows, and it may be a flight of arrows that
      harmed an ashler wall as little as so many hailstones. But we must jouk
      and let the jaw gang by.&rdquo; Comforting himself in his state of diminished
      consequence with this pithy old proverb, Peter Bridgeward lowered the
      drawbridge, and permitted them to pass over. At the sight of his white
      hair, albeit it discovered a visage equally peevish through age and
      misfortune, Roland was inclined to give him an alms, but Adam Woodcock
      prevented him. &ldquo;E'en let him pay the penalty of his former churlishness
      and greed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the wolf, when he has lost his teeth, should be
      treated no better than a cur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the Bridgeward to lament the alteration of times, which sent
      domineering soldiers and feudal retainers to his place of passage, instead
      of peaceful pilgrims, and reduced him to become the oppressed, instead of
      playing the extortioner, the travellers turned them northward; and Adam
      Woodcock, well acquainted with that part of the country, proposed to cut
      short a considerable portion of the road, by traversing the little vale of
      Glendearg, so famous for the adventures which befell therein during the
      earlier part of the Benedictine's manuscript. With these, and with the
      thousand commentaries, representations, and misrepresentations, to which
      they had given rise, Roland Graeme was, of course, well acquainted; for in
      the Castle of Avenel, as well as in other great establishments, the
      inmates talked of nothing so often, or with such pleasure, as of the
      private affairs of their lord and lady. But while Roland was viewing with
      interest these haunted scenes, in which things were said to have passed
      beyond the ordinary laws of nature, Adam Woodcock was still regretting in
      his secret soul the unfinished revel and the unsung ballad, and kept every
      now and then, breaking out with some such verses as these:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;The Friars of Fail drank berry-brown ale,
       The best that e'er was tasted;
     The Monks of Melrose made gude kale
       On Fridays, when they fasted.
          Saint Monance' sister.
          The gray priest kist her&mdash;
           Fiend save the company!
          Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix.
            Under the greenwood tree.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my hand, friend Woodcock,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;though I know you for a
      hardy gospeller, that fear neither saint nor devil, yet, if I were you, I
      would not sing your profane songs in this valley of Glendearg, considering
      what has happened here before our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A straw for your wandering spirits!&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock; &ldquo;I mind them no
      more than an earn cares for a string of wild-geese&mdash;they have all
      fled since the pulpits were filled with honest men, and the people's ears
      with sound doctrine. Nay, I have a touch at them in my ballad, an I had
      but had the good luck to have it sung to end;&rdquo; and again he set off in the
      same key:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  From haunted spring and grassy ring,
    Troop goblin, elf, and fairy;
  And the kelpie must flit from the black bog-pit,
    And the brownie must not tarry;
       To Limbo-lake,
       Their way they take,
         With scarce the pith to flee.
       Sing hay trix, trim-go-trix,
         Under the greenwood tree.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that could Sir Halbert's patience have stretched
      till we came that length, he would have had a hearty laugh, and that is
      what he seldom enjoys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be all true that men tell of his early life,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;he has
      less right to laugh at goblins than most men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, <i>if</i> it be all true,&rdquo; answered Adam Woodcock; &ldquo;but who can
      ensure us of that? Moreover, these were but tales the monks used to gull
      us simple laymen withal; they knew that fairies and hobgoblins brought
      aves and paternosters into repute; but, now we have given up worship of
      images in wood and stone, methinks it were no time to be afraid of bubbles
      in the water, or shadows in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;as the Catholics say they do not worship
      wood or stone, but only as emblems of the holy saints, and not as things
      holy in themselves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! pshaw!&rdquo; answered the falconer; &ldquo;a rush for their prating. They
      told us another story when these baptized idols of theirs brought
      pike-staves and sandalled shoon from all the four winds, and whillied the
      old women out of their corn and their candle ends, and their butter,
      bacon, wool, and cheese, and when not so much as a gray groat escaped
      tithing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme had been long taught, by necessity, to consider his form of
      religion as a profound secret, and to say nothing whatever in its defence
      when assailed, lest he should draw on himself the suspicion of belonging
      to the unpopular and exploded church. He therefore suffered Adam Woodcock
      to triumph without farther opposition, marvelling in his own mind whether
      any of the goblins, formerly such active agents, would avenge his rude
      raillery before they left the valley of Glendearg. But no such
      consequences followed. They passed the night quietly in a cottage in the
      glen, and the next day resumed their route to Edinburgh.

      Chapter the Seventeenth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edina! Scotia's darling seat,  All hail thy palaces and towers,
Where once, beneath a monarch's feet,  Sate legislation's sovereign powers.
                          BURNS.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, is Edinburgh?&rdquo; said the youth, as the fellow-travellers
      arrived at one of the heights to the southward, which commanded a view of
      the great northern capital&mdash;&ldquo;This is that Edinburgh of which we have
      heard so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;yonder stands Auld Reekie&mdash;you may see
      the smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance, as the gosshawk hangs
      over a plump of young wild-ducks&mdash;ay, yonder is the heart of
      Scotland, and each throb that she gives is felt from the edge of Solway to
      Duncan's-bay-head. See, yonder is the old Castle; and see to the right, on
      yon rising ground, that is the Castle of Craigmillar, which I have known a
      merry place in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not there,&rdquo; said the page in a low voice, &ldquo;that the Queen held her
      court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; replied the falconer, &ldquo;Queen she was then, though you must not
      call her so now. Well, they may say what they will&mdash;many a true heart
      will be sad for Mary Stewart, e'en if all be true men say of her; for look
      you, Master Roland&mdash;she was the loveliest creature to look upon that
      I ever saw with eye, and no lady in the land liked better the fair flight
      of a falcon. I was at the great match on Roslin Moor betwixt Bothwell&mdash;he
      was a black sight to her that Bothwell&mdash;and the Baron of Roslin, who
      could judge a hawk's flight as well as any man in Scotland&mdash;a butt of
      Rhenish and a ring of gold was the wager, and it was flown as fairly for
      as ever was red gold and bright wine. And to see her there on her white
      palfrey, that flew as if it scorned to touch more than the heather
      blossom; and to hear her voice, as clear and sweet as the mavis's whistle,
      mix among our jolly whooping and whistling; and to mark all the nobles
      dashing round her; happiest he who got a word or a look&mdash;tearing
      through moss and hagg, and venturing neck and limb to gain the praise of a
      bold rider, and the blink of a bonny Queen's bright eye!&mdash;she will
      see little hawking where she lies now&mdash;ay, ay, pomp and pleasure pass
      away as speedily as the wap of a falcon's wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is this poor Queen now confined?&rdquo; said Roland Graeme,
      interested in the fate of a woman whose beauty and grace had made so
      strong an impression even on the blunt and careless character of Adam
      Woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now imprisoned?&rdquo; said honest Adam; &ldquo;why, in some castle in
      the north, they say&mdash;I know not where, for my part, nor is it worth
      while to vex one's sell anent what cannot be mended&mdash;An she had
      guided her power well whilst she had it, she had not come to so evil a
      pass. Men say she must resign her crown to this little baby of a prince,
      for that they will trust her with it no longer. Our master has been as
      busy as his neighbours in all this work. If the Queen should come to her
      own again, Avenel Castle is like to smoke for it, unless he makes his
      bargain all the better.&rdquo; &ldquo;In a castle in the north Queen Mary is
      confined?&rdquo; said the page. &ldquo;Why, ay&mdash;they say so, at least&mdash;In a
      castle beyond that great river which comes down yonder, and looks like a
      river, but it is a branch of the sea, and as bitter as brine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And amongst all her subjects,&rdquo; said the page, with some emotion, &ldquo;is
      there none that will adventure anything for her relief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a kittle question,&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;and if you ask it often,
      Master Roland, I am fain to tell you that you will be mewed up yourself in
      some of those castles, if they do not prefer twisting your head off, to
      save farther trouble with you&mdash;Adventure any thing? Lord, why, Murray
      has the wind in his poop now, man, and flies so high and strong, that the
      devil a wing of them can match him&mdash;No, no; there she is, and there
      she must lie, till Heaven send her deliverance, or till her son has the
      management of all&mdash;But Murray will never let her loose again, he
      knows her too well.&mdash;And hark thee, we are now bound for Holyrood,
      where thou wilt find plenty of news, and of courtiers to tell it&mdash;But,
      take my counsel, and keep a calm sough, as the Scots say&mdash;hear every
      man's counsel, and keep your own. And if you hap to learn any news you
      like, leap not up as if you were to put on armour direct in the cause&mdash;Our
      old Mr. Wingate says&mdash;and he knows court-cattle well&mdash;that if
      you are told old King Coul is come alive again, you should turn it off
      with, 'And is he in truth?&mdash;I heard not of it,' and should seem no
      more moved, than if one told you, by way of novelty, that old King Coul
      was dead and buried. Wherefore, look well to your bearing, Master Roland,
      for, I promise you, you come among a generation that are keen as a hungry
      hawk&mdash;And never be dagger out of sheath at every wry word you hear
      spoken; for you will find as hot blades as yourself, and then will be
      letting of blood without advice either of leech or almanack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see how staid I will be, and how cautious, my good friend,&rdquo;
       said Graeme; &ldquo;but, blessed Lady, what goodly house is that which is lying
      all in ruins so close to the city? Have they been playing at the Abbot of
      Unreason here, and ended the gambol by burning the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There again now,&rdquo; replied his companion, &ldquo;you go down the wind like a
      wild haggard, that minds neither lure nor beck&mdash;that is a question
      you should have asked in as low a tone as I shall answer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I stay here long,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;it is like I shall lose the
      natural use of my voice&mdash;but what are the ruins then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Kirk of Field,&rdquo; said the falconer, in a low and impressive whisper,
      laying at the same time his finger on his lip; &ldquo;ask no more about it&mdash;somebody
      got foul play, and somebody got the blame of it; and the game began there
      which perhaps may not be played out in our time.&mdash;Poor Henry Darnley!
      to be an ass, he understood somewhat of a hawk; but they sent him on the
      wing through the air himself one bright moonlight night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The memory of this catastrophe was so recent, that the page averted his
      eyes with horror from the scathed ruins in which it had taken place; and
      the accusations against the Queen, to which it had given rise, came over
      his mind with such strength as to balance the compassion he had begun to
      entertain for her present forlorn situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, with that agitating state of mind which arises partly from
      horror, but more from anxious interest and curiosity, that young Graeme
      found himself actually traversing the scene of those tremendous events,
      the report of which had disturbed the most distant solitudes in Scotland,
      like the echoes of distant thunder rolling among the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;now or never shall I become a man, and bear my part in
      those deeds which the simple inhabitants of our hamlets repeat to each
      other, as if they were wrought by beings of a superior order to their own.
      I will know now, wherefore the Knight of Avenel carries his crest so much
      above those of the neighbouring baronage, and how it is that men, by
      valour and wisdom, work their way from the hoddin-gray coat to the cloak
      of scarlet and gold. Men say I have not much wisdom to recommend me; and
      if that be true, courage must do it; for I will be a man amongst living
      men, or a dead corpse amongst the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From these dreams of ambition he turned his thoughts to those of pleasure,
      and began to form many conjectures, when and where he should see Catherine
      Seyton, and in what manner their acquaintance was to be renewed. With such
      conjectures he was amusing himself, when he found that they had entered
      the city, and all other feelings were suspended in the sensation of giddy
      astonishment with which an inhabitant of the country is affected, when,
      for the first time, he finds himself in the streets of a large and
      populous city, a unit in the midst of thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal street of Edinburgh was then, as now, one of the most
      spacious in Europe. The extreme height of the houses, and the variety of
      Gothic gables and battlements, and balconies, by which the sky-line on
      each side was crowned and terminated, together with the width of the
      street itself, might have struck with surprise a more practised eye than
      that of young Graeme. The population, close packed within the walls of the
      city, and at this time increased by the number of the lords of the King's
      party who had thronged to Edinburgh to wait upon the Regent Murray,
      absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide and stately street. Instead of
      the shop-windows, which are now calculated for the display of goods, the
      traders had their open booths projecting on the street, in which, as in
      the fashion of the modern bazaars, all was exposed which they had upon
      sale. And though the commodities were not of the richest kinds, yet Graeme
      thought he beheld the wealth of the whole world in the various bales of
      Flanders cloths, and the specimens of tapestry; and, at other places, the
      display of domestic utensils and pieces of plate struck him with wonder.
      The sight of cutlers' booths, furnished with swords and poniards, which
      were manufactured in Scotland, and with pieces of defensive armour,
      imported from Flanders, added to his surprise; and, at every step, he
      found so much to admire and gaze upon, that Adam Woodcock had no little
      difficulty in prevailing on him to advance through such a scene of
      enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the crowds which filled the streets was equally a subject of
      wonder. Here a gay lady, in her muffler, or silken veil, traced her way
      delicately, a gentleman-usher making way for her, a page bearing up her
      train, and a waiting gentlewoman carrying her Bible, thus intimating that
      her purpose was towards the church&mdash;There he might see a group of
      citizens bending the same way, with their short Flemish cloaks, wide
      trowsers, and high-caped doublets, a fashion to which, as well as to their
      bonnet and feather, the Scots were long faithful. Then, again, came the
      clergyman himself, in his black Geneva cloak and band, lending a grave and
      attentive ear to the discourse of several persons who accompanied him, and
      who were doubtless holding serious converse on the religious subject he
      was about to treat of. Nor did there lack passengers of a different class
      and appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every turn, Roland Graeme might see a gallant ruffle along in the newer
      or French mode, his doublet slashed, and his points of the same colours
      with the lining, his long sword on one side, and his poniard on the other,
      behind him a body of stout serving men, proportioned to his estate and
      quality, all of whom walked with the air of military retainers, and were
      armed with sword and buckler, the latter being a small round shield, not
      unlike the Highland target, having a steel spike in the centre. Two of
      these parties, each headed by a person of importance, chanced to meet in
      the very centre of the street, or, as it was called, &ldquo;the crown of the
      cause-way,&rdquo; a post of honour as tenaciously asserted in Scotland, as that
      of giving or taking the wall used to be in the more southern part of the
      island. The two leaders being of equal rank, and, most probably, either
      animated by political dislike, or by recollection of some feudal enmity,
      marched close up to each other, without yielding an inch to the right or
      the left; and neither showing the least purpose of giving way, they
      stopped for an instant, and then drew their swords. Their followers
      imitated their example; about a score of weapons at once flashed in the
      sun, and there was an immediate clatter of swords and bucklers, while the
      followers on either side cried their master's name; the one shouting
      &ldquo;Help, a Leslie! a Leslie!&rdquo; while the others answered with shouts of
      &ldquo;Seyton! Seyton!&rdquo; with the additional punning slogan, &ldquo;Set on, set on&mdash;bear
      the knaves to the ground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the falconer found difficulty in getting the page to go forward before,
      it was now perfectly impossible. He reined up his horse, clapped his
      hands, and, delighted with the fray, cried and shouted as fast as any of
      those who were actually engaged in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise and cries thus arising on the Highgate, as it was called, drew
      into the quarrel two or three other parties of gentlemen and their
      servants, besides some single passengers, who, hearing a fray betwixt
      these two distinguished names, took part in it, either for love or hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combat became now very sharp, and although the sword-and-buckler men
      made more clatter and noise than they did real damage, yet several good
      cuts were dealt among them; and those who wore rapiers, a more formidable
      weapon than the ordinary Scottish swords, gave and received dangerous
      wounds. Two men were already stretched on the causeway, and the party of
      Seyton began to give ground, being much inferior in number to the other,
      with which several of the citizens had united themselves, when young
      Roland Graeme, beholding their leader, a noble gentleman, fighting
      bravely, and hard pressed with numbers, could withhold no longer. &ldquo;Adam
      Woodcock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an you be a man, draw, and let us take part with the
      Seyton.&rdquo; And, without waiting a reply, or listening to the falconer's
      earnest entreaty, that he would leave alone a strife in which he had no
      concern, the fiery youth sprung from his horse, drew his short sword, and
      shouting like the rest, &ldquo;A Seyton! a Seyton! Set on! set on!&rdquo; thrust
      forward into the throng, and struck down one of those who was pressing
      hardest upon the gentleman whose cause he espoused. This sudden
      reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker party, who began to renew the
      combat with much alacrity, when four of the magistrates of the city,
      distinguished by their velvet cloaks and gold chains, came up with a guard
      of halberdiers and citizens, armed with long weapons, and well accustomed
      to such service, thrust boldly forward, and compelled the swordsmen to
      separate, who immediately retreated in different directions, leaving such
      of the wounded on both sides, as had been disabled in the fray, lying on
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer, who had been tearing his beard for anger at his comrade's
      rashness, now rode up to him with the horse which he had caught by the
      bridle, and accosted him with &ldquo;Master Roland&mdash;master goose&mdash;master
      mad-cap&mdash;will it please you to get on horse, and budge? or will you
      remain here to be carried to prison, and made to answer for this pretty
      day's work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page, who had begun his retreat along with the Seytons, just as if he
      had been one of their natural allies, was by this unceremonious
      application made sensible that he was acting a foolish part; and, obeying
      Adam Woodcock with some sense of shame, he sprung actively on horseback,
      and upsetting with the shoulder of the animal a city-officer, who was
      making towards him, he began to ride smartly down the street, along with
      his companion, and was quickly out of the reach of the hue and cry. In
      fact, rencounters of the kind were so common in Edinburgh at that period,
      that the disturbance seldom excited much attention after the affray was
      over, unless some person of consequence chanced to have fallen, an
      incident which imposed on his friends the duty of avenging his death on
      the first convenient opportunity. So feeble, indeed, was the arm of the
      police, that it was not unusual for such skirmishes to last for hours,
      where the parties were numerous and well matched. But at this time the
      Regent, a man of great strength of character, aware of the mischief which
      usually arose from such acts of violence, had prevailed with the
      magistrates to keep a constant guard on foot for preventing or separating
      such affrays as had happened in the present case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer and his young companion were now riding down the Canongate,
      and had slackened their pace to avoid attracting attention, the rather
      that there seemed to be no appearance of pursuit. Roland hung his head as
      one who was conscious his conduct had been none of the wisest, whilst his
      companion thus addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be pleased to tell me one thing, Master Roland Graeme, and that
      is, whether there be a devil incarnate in you or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, Master Adam Woodcock,&rdquo; answered the page, &ldquo;I would fain hope there
      is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;I would fain know by what other influence or
      instigation you are perpetually at one end or the other of some bloody
      brawl? What, I pray, had you to do with these Seytons and Leslies, that
      you never heard the names of in your life before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out there, my friend,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I have my own reasons
      for being a friend to the Seytons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have been very secret reasons then,&rdquo; answered Adam Woodcock,
      &ldquo;for I think I could have wagered, you had never known one of the name;
      and I am apt to believe still, that it was your unhallowed passion for
      that clashing of cold iron, which has as much charm for you as the clatter
      of a brass pan hath for a hive of bees, rather than any care either for
      Seyton or for Leslie, that persuaded you to thrust your fool's head into a
      quarrel that no ways concerned you. But take this for a warning, my young
      master, that if you are to draw sword with every man who draws sword on
      the Highgate here, it will be scarce worth your while to sheathe bilbo
      again for the rest of your life, since, if I guess rightly, it will scarce
      endure on such terms for many hours&mdash;all which I leave to your
      serious consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word, Adam, I honour your advice; and I promise you, that I will
      practise by it as faithfully as if I were sworn apprentice to you, to the
      trade and mystery of bearing myself with all wisdom and safety through the
      new paths of life that I am about to be engaged in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therein you will do well,&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;and I do not quarrel
      with you, Master Roland, for having a grain over much spirit, because I
      know one may bring to the hand a wild hawk which one never can a dung-hill
      hen&mdash;and so betwixt two faults you have the best on't. But besides
      your peculiar genius for quarrelling and lugging out your side companion,
      my dear Master Roland, you have also the gift of peering under every
      woman's muffler and screen, as if you expected to find an old
      acquaintance. Though were you to spy one, I should be as much surprised at
      it, well wotting how few you have seen of these same wild-fowl, as I was
      at your taking so deep an interest even now in the Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man! nonsense and folly,&rdquo; answered Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I but sought to
      see what eyes these gentle hawks have got under their hood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but it's a dangerous subject of inquiry,&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;you had
      better hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to perch upon.&mdash;Look
      you, Master Roland, these pretty wild-geese cannot be hawked at without
      risk&mdash;they have as many divings, boltings, and volleyings, as the
      most gamesome quarry that falcon ever flew at&mdash;And besides, every
      woman of them is manned with her husband, or her kind friend, or her
      brother, or her cousin, or her sworn servant at the least&mdash;But you
      heed me not, Master Roland, though I know the game so well&mdash;your eye
      is all on that pretty damsel who trips down the gate before us&mdash;by my
      certes, I will warrant her a blithe dancer either in reel or revel&mdash;a
      pair of silver morisco bells would become these pretty ankles as well as
      the jesses would suit the fairest Norway hawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a fool, Adam,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;and I care not a button about the
      girl or her ankles&mdash;But, what the foul fiend, one must look at
      something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Master Roland Graeme,&rdquo; said his guide, &ldquo;but let me pray you to
      choose your objects better. Look you, there is scarce a woman walks this
      High-gate with a silk screen or a pearlin muffler, but, as I said before,
      she has either gentleman-usher before her, or kinsman, or lover, or
      husband, at her elbow, or it may be a brace of stout fellows with sword
      and buckler, not so far behind but what they can follow close&mdash;But
      you heed me no more than a goss-hawk minds a yellow yoldring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, I do&mdash;I do mind you indeed,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;but hold my
      nag a bit&mdash;I will be with you in the exchange of a whistle.&rdquo; So
      saying, and ere Adam Woodcock could finish the sermon which was dying on
      his tongue, Roland Graeme, to the falconer's utter astonishment, threw him
      the bridle of his jennet, jumped off horseback, and pursued down one of
      the closes or narrow lanes, which, opening under a vault, terminate upon
      the main-street, the very maiden to whom his friend had accused him of
      showing so much attention, and who had turned down the pass in question.
    </p>

      &ldquo;Saint Mary, Saint Magdalen, Saint Benedict, Saint Barnabas!&rdquo; said the
      poor falconer, when he found himself thus suddenly brought to a pause in
      the midst of the Canongate, and saw his young charge start off like a
      madman in quest of a damsel whom he had never, as Adam supposed, seen in
      his life before,&mdash;&ldquo;Saint Satan and Saint Beelzebub&mdash;for this
      would make one swear saint and devil&mdash;what can have come over the
      lad, with a wanion! And what shall I do the whilst!&mdash;he will have his
      throat cut, the poor lad, as sure as I was born at the foot of
      Roseberry-Topping. Could I find some one to hold the horses! but they are
      as sharp here north-away as in canny Yorkshire herself, and quit bridle,
      quit titt, as we say. An I could but see one of our folks now, a
      holly-sprig were worth a gold tassel; or could I but see one of the
      Regent's men&mdash;but to leave the horses to a stranger, that I cannot&mdash;and
      to leave the place while the lad is in jeopardy, that I wonot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must leave the falconer, however, in the midst of his distress, and
      follow the hot-headed youth who was the cause of his perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of Adam Woodcock's sage remonstrance had been in a great
      measure lost upon Roland, for whose benefit it was intended; because, in
      one of the female forms which tripped along the street, muffled in a veil
      of striped silk, like the women of Brussels at this day, his eye had
      discerned something which closely resembled the exquisite shape and
      spirited bearing of Catherine Seyton.&mdash;During all the grave advice
      which the falconer was dinning in his ears, his eye continued intent upon
      so interesting an object of observation; and at length, as the damsel,
      just about to dive under one of the arched passages which afforded an
      outlet to the Canongate from the houses beneath, (a passage, graced by a
      projecting shield of arms, supported by two huge foxes of stone,) had
      lifted her veil for the purpose perhaps of descrying who the horseman was
      who for some time had eyed her so closely, young Roland saw, under the
      shade of the silken plaid, enough of the bright azure eyes, fair locks,
      and blithe features, to induce him, like an inexperienced and rash madcap,
      whose wilful ways never had been traversed by contradiction, nor much
      subjected to consideration, to throw the bridle of his horse into Adam
      Woodcock's hand, and leave him to play the waiting gentleman, while he
      dashed down the paved court after Catherine Seyton&mdash;all as aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women's wits are proverbially quick, but apparently those of Catherine
      suggested no better expedient than fairly to betake herself to speed of
      foot, in hopes of baffling the page's vivacity, by getting safely lodged
      before he could discover where. But a youth of eighteen, in pursuit of a
      mistress, is not so easily outstripped. Catherine fled across a paved
      court, decorated with large formal vases of stone, in which yews,
      cypresses, and other evergreens, vegetated in sombre sullenness, and gave
      a correspondent degree of solemnity to the high and heavy building in
      front of which they were placed as ornaments, aspiring towards a square
      portion of the blue hemisphere, corresponding exactly in extent to the
      quadrangle in which they were stationed, and all around which rose huge
      black walls, exhibiting windows in rows of five stories, with heavy
      architraves over each, bearing armorial and religious devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this court Catherine Seyton flashed like a hunted doe, making the
      best use of those pretty legs which had attracted the commendation even of
      the reflective and cautious Adam Woodcock. She hastened towards a large
      door in the centre of the lower front of the court, pulled the bobbin till
      the latch flew up, and ensconced herself in the ancient mansion. But, if
      she fled like a doe, Roland Graeme followed with the speed and ardour of a
      youthful stag-hound, loosed for the first time on his prey. He kept her in
      view in spite of her efforts; for it is remarkable what an advantage, in
      such a race, the gallant who desires to see, possesses over the maiden who
      wishes not to be seen&mdash;an advantage which I have known counterbalance
      a great start in point of distance. In short, he saw the waving of her
      screen, or veil, at one corner, heard the tap of her foot, light as that
      was, as it crossed the court, and caught a glimpse of her figure just as
      she entered the door of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme, inconsiderate and headlong as we have described him, having
      no knowledge of real life but from the romances which he had read, and not
      an idea of checking himself in the midst of any eager impulse; possessed,
      besides, of much courage and readiness, never hesitated for a moment to
      approach the door through which the object of his search had disappeared.
      He, too, pulled the bobbin, and the latch, though heavy and massive,
      answered to the summons, and arose. The page entered with the same
      precipitation which had marked his whole proceeding, and found himself in
      a large hall, or vestibule, dimly enlightened by latticed casements of
      painted glass, and rendered yet dimmer through the exclusion of the
      sunbeams, owing to the height of the walls of those buildings by which the
      court-yard was enclosed. The walls of the hall were surrounded with suits
      of ancient and rusted armour, interchanged with huge and massive stone
      scutcheons, bearing double tressures, fleured and counter-fleured,
      wheat-sheaves, coronets, and so forth, things to which Roland Graeme gave
      not a moment's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, he only deigned to observe the figure of Catherine Seyton, who,
      deeming herself safe in the hall, had stopped to take breath after her
      course, and was reposing herself for a moment on a large oaken settle
      which stood at the upper end of the hall. The noise of Roland's entrance
      at once disturbed her; she started up with a faint scream of surprise, and
      escaped through one of the several folding-doors which opened into this
      apartment as a common centre. This door, which Roland Graeme instantly
      approached, opened on a large and well-lighted gallery, at the upper end
      of which he could hear several voices, and the noise of hasty steps
      approaching towards the hall or vestibule. A little recalled to sober
      thought by an appearance of serious danger, he was deliberating whether he
      should stand fast or retire, when Catherine Seyton re-entered from a side
      door, running towards him with as much speed as a few minutes since she
      had fled from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what mischief brought you hither?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;fly&mdash;fly, or you
      are a dead man,&mdash;or stay&mdash;they come&mdash;flight is impossible&mdash;say
      you came to ask for Lord Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprung from him and disappeared through the door by which she had made
      her second appearance; and, at the same instant, a pair of large
      folding-doors at the upper end of the gallery flew open with vehemence,
      and six or seven young gentlemen, richly dressed, pressed forward into the
      apartment, having, for the greater part, their swords drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;dare intrude on us in our own mansion?&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0275}.jpg" alt="{0275}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0275}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut him to pieces,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;let him pay for this day's insolence
      and violence&mdash;he is some follower of the Rothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Saint Mary,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;he is a follower of the arch-fiend and
      ennobled clown Halbert Glendinning, who takes the style of Avenel&mdash;once
      a church-vassal, now a pillager of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said a fourth; &ldquo;I know him by the holly-sprig, which is their
      cognizance. Secure the door, he must answer for this insolence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the gallants, hastily drawing their weapons, passed on to the door
      by which Roland had entered the hall, and stationed themselves there as if
      to prevent his escape. The others advanced on Graeme, who had just sense
      enough to perceive that any attempt at resistance would be alike fruitless
      and imprudent. At once, and by various voices, none of which sounded
      amicably, the page was required to say who he was, whence he came, his
      name, his errand, and who sent him hither. The number of the questions
      demanded of him at once, afforded a momentary apology for his remaining
      silent, and ere that brief truce had elapsed, a personage entered the
      hall, at whose appearance those who had gathered fiercely around Roland,
      fell back with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a tall man, whose dark hair was already grizzled, though his high
      and haughty features retained all the animation of youth. The upper part
      of his person was undressed to his Holland shirt, whose ample folds were
      stained with blood. But he wore a mantle of crimson, lined with rich fur,
      cast around him, which supplied the deficiency of his dress. On his head
      he had a crimson velvet bonnet, looped up on one side with a small golden
      chain of many links, which, going thrice around the hat, was fastened by a
      medal, agreeable to the fashion amongst the grandees of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have you here, sons and kinsmen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;around whom you crowd
      thus roughly?&mdash;Know you not that the shelter of this roof should
      secure every one fair treatment, who shall come hither either in fair
      peace, or in open and manly hostility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here, my lord,&rdquo; answered one of the youths, &ldquo;is a knave who comes on
      treacherous espial!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny the charge!&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, boldly, &ldquo;I came to inquire after
      my Lord Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A likely tale,&rdquo; answered his accusers, &ldquo;in the mouth of a follower of
      Glendinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, young men,&rdquo; said the Lord Seyton, for it was that nobleman himself,
      &ldquo;let me look at this youth&mdash;By heaven, it is the very same who came
      so boldly to my side not very many minutes since, when some of my own
      knaves bore themselves with more respect to their own worshipful safety
      than to mine! Stand back from him, for he well deserves honour and a
      friendly welcome at your hands, instead of this rough treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They fell back on all sides, obedient to Lord Seyton's commands, who,
      taking Roland Graeme by the hand, thanked him for his prompt and gallant
      assistance, adding, that he nothing doubted, &ldquo;the same interest which he
      had taken in his cause in the affray, brought him hither to inquire after
      his hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland bowed low in acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is there any thing in which I can serve you, to show my sense of your
      ready gallantry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the page, thinking it best to abide by the apology for his visit which
      the Lord Seyton had so aptly himself suggested, replied, &ldquo;that to be
      assured of his lordship's safety, had been the only cause of his
      intrusion. He judged,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;he had seen him receive some hurt in the
      affray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trifle,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton; &ldquo;I had but stripped my doublet, that the
      chirurgeon might put some dressing on the paltry scratch, when these rash
      boys interrupted us with their clamour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme, making a low obeisance, was now about to depart, for,
      relieved from the danger of being treated as a spy, he began next to fear,
      that his companion, Adam Woodcock, whom he had so unceremoniously quitted,
      would either bring him into some farther dilemma, by venturing into the
      hotel in quest of him, or ride off and leave him behind altogether. But
      Lord Seyton did not permit him to escape so easily. &ldquo;Tarry,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;young man, and let me know thy rank and name. The Seyton has of late been
      more wont to see friends and followers shrink from his side, than to
      receive aid from strangers-but a new world may come around, in which he
      may have the chance of rewarding his well-wishers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Roland Graeme, my lord,&rdquo; answered the youth, &ldquo;a page, who, for
      the present, is in the service of Sir Halbert Glendinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said so from the first,&rdquo; said one of the young men; &ldquo;my life I will
      wager, that this is a shaft out of the heretic's quiver-a stratagem from
      first to last, to injeer into your confidence some espial of his own. They
      know how to teach both boys and women to play the intelligencers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is false, if it be spoken of me,&rdquo; said Roland; &ldquo;no man in Scotland
      should teach me such a foul part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe thee, boy,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton, &ldquo;for thy strokes were too fair to
      be dealt upon an understanding with those that were to receive them.
      Credit me, however, I little expected to have help at need from one of
      your master's household; and I would know what moved thee in my quarrel,
      to thine own endangering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please you, my lord,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;I think my master himself would
      not have stood by, and seen an honourable man borne to earth by odds, if
      his single arm could help him. Such, at least, is the lesson we were
      taught in chivalry, at the Castle of Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good seed hath fallen into good ground, young man,&rdquo; said Seyton;
      &ldquo;but, alas! if thou practise such honourable war in these dishonourable
      days, when right is every where borne down by mastery, thy life, my poor
      boy, will be but a short one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be short, so it be honourable,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;and permit me
      now, my lord, to commend me to your grace, and to take my leave. A comrade
      waits with my horse in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this, however, young man,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton,
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: George, fifth Lord Seton, was immovably faithful to Queen Mary
      during all the mutabilities of her fortune. He was grand master of the
      household, in which capacity he had a picture painted of himself, with his
      official baton, and the following motto:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In adversitate, patiens;
  In prosperitate, benevolus.
  Hazard, yet forward.
</pre>
    <p>
      On various parts of his castle he inscribed, as expressing his religious
      and political creed, the legend:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Un Dieu, un Foy, un Roy, un Loy.
</pre>
    <p>
      He declined to be promoted to an earldom, which Queen Mary offered him at
      the same time when she advanced her natural brother to be Earl of Mar, and
      afterwards of Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his refusing this honour, Mary wrote, or caused to be written, the
      following lines in Latin and French:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sunt comites, ducesque alii; sunt denique reges;
  Sethom dominum sit satis esse mihi.

  Il y a des comptes, des roys, des ducs; ainsi
  C'est assez pour moy d'estre Seigneur de Seton.
</pre>
    <p>
      Which may be thus rendered:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Earl, duke, or king, be thou that list to be:
  Seton, thy lordship is enough for me.
</pre>
    <p>
      This distich reminds us of the &ldquo;pride which aped humility,&rdquo; in the motto
      of the house of Couci:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Je suis ni roy, ni prince aussi;
  Je suis le Seigneur de Coucy.
</pre>
    <p>
      After the battle of Langside, Lord Seton was obliged to retire abroad for
      safety, and was an exile for two years, during which he was reduced to the
      necessity of driving a waggon in Flanders for his subsistence. He rose to
      favour in James VI's reign, and assuming his paternal property, had
      himself painted in his waggoner's dress, and in the act of driving a wain
      with four horses, on the north end of a stately gallery at Seton Castle]
    </p>
    <p>
      undoing from his bonnet the golden chain and medal, &ldquo;and wear it for my
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With no little pride Roland Graeme accepted the gift, which he hastily
      fastened around his bonnet, as he had seen gallants wear such an ornament,
      and renewing his obeisance to the Baron, left the hall, traversed the
      court, and appeared in the street, just as Adam Woodcock, vexed and
      anxious at his delay, had determined to leave the horses to their fate,
      and go in quest of his youthful comrade. &ldquo;Whose barn hast thou broken
      next?&rdquo; he exclaimed, greatly relieved by his appearance, although his
      countenance indicated that he had passed through an agitating scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me no questions,&rdquo; said Roland, leaping gaily on his horse; &ldquo;but see
      how short time it takes to win a chain of gold,&rdquo; pointing to that which he
      now wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, God forbid that thou hast either stolen it, or reft it by violence,&rdquo;
       said the falconer; &ldquo;for, otherwise, I wot not how the devil thou couldst
      compass it. I have been often here, ay, for months at an end, and no one
      gave me either chain or medal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou seest I have got one on shorter acquaintance with the city,&rdquo;
       answered the page, &ldquo;but set thine honest heart at rest; that which is
      fairly won and freely given, is neither reft nor stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, hang thee, with thy fanfarona [Footnote: A name given to the gold
      chains worn by the military men of the period. It is of Spanish origin:
      for the fashion of wearing these costly ornaments was much followed
      amongst the conquerors of the New World.] about thy neck!&rdquo; said the
      falconer; &ldquo;I think water will not drown, nor hemp strangle thee. Thou hast
      been discarded as my lady's page, to come in again as my lord's squire;
      and for following a noble young damsel into some great household, thou
      gettest a chain and medal, where another would have had the baton across
      his shoulders, if he missed having the dirk in his body. But here we come
      in front of the old Abbey. Bear thy good luck with you when you cross
      these paved stones, and, by our Lady, you may brag Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, they checked their horses, where the huge old vaulted
      entrance to the Abbey or Palace of Holyrood crossed the termination of the
      street down which they had proceeded. The courtyard of the palace opened
      within this gloomy porch, showing the front of an irregular pile of
      monastic buildings, one wing of which is still extant, forming a part of
      the modern palace, erected in the days of Charles I.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of the porch the falconer and page resigned their horses to
      the serving-man in attendance; the falconer commanding him with an air of
      authority, to carry them safely to the stables. &ldquo;We follow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      Knight of Avenel&mdash;We must bear ourselves for what we are here,&rdquo; said
      he in a whisper to Roland, &ldquo;for every one here is looked on as they demean
      themselves; and he that is too modest must to the wall, as the proverb
      says; therefore cock thy bonnet, man, and let us brook the causeway
      bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assuming, therefore, an air of consequence, corresponding to what he
      supposed to be his master's importance and quality, Adam Woodcock led the
      way into the courtyard of the Palace of Holyrood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appears to have been fond of the arts; for there exists a beautiful
      family-piece of him in the centre of his family. Mr. Pinkerton, in his
      Scottish Iconographia, published an engraving of this curious portrait.
      The original is the property of Lord Somerville, nearly connected with the
      Seton family, and is at present at his lordship's fishing villa of the
      Pavilion, near Melrose.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;The sky is clouded, Gaspard,
  And the vexed ocean sleeps a troubled sleep,
  Beneath a lurid gleam of parting sunshine.
  Such slumber hangs o'er discontented lands,
  While factions doubt, as yet, if they have strength
  To front the open battle.

    <p>
      The youthful page paused on the entrance of the court-yard, and implored
      his guide to give him a moment's breathing space. &ldquo;Let me but look around
      me, man,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you consider not I have never seen such a scene as
      this before.&mdash;And this is Holyrood&mdash;the resort of the gallant
      and gay, and the fair, and the wise, and the powerful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, marry, is it!&rdquo; said Woodcock; &ldquo;but I wish I could hood thee as they
      do the hawks, for thou starest as wildly as if you sought another fray or
      another fanfarona. I would I had thee safely housed, for thou lookest wild
      as a goss-hawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed no common sight to Roland, the vestibule of a palace
      traversed by its various groups,&mdash;some radiant with gaiety&mdash;some
      pensive, and apparently weighed down by affairs concerning the state, or
      concerning themselves. Here the hoary statesman, with his cautious yet
      commanding look, his furred cloak and sable pantoufles; there the soldier
      in buff and steel, his long sword jarring against the pavement, and his
      whiskered upper lip and frowning brow, looking an habitual defiance of
      danger, which perhaps was not always made good; there again passed my
      lord's serving-man, high of heart, and bloody of hand, humble to his
      master and his master's equals, insolent to all others. To these might be
      added, the poor suitor, with his anxious look and depressed mien&mdash;the
      officer, full of his brief authority, elbowing his betters, and possibly
      his benefactors, out of the road&mdash;the proud priest, who sought a
      better benefice&mdash;the proud baron, who sought a grant of church lands&mdash;the
      robber chief, who came to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had
      inflicted on his neighbors&mdash;the plundered franklin, who came to seek
      vengeance for that which he had himself received. Besides there was the
      mustering and disposition of guards and soldiers&mdash;the despatching of
      messengers, and the receiving them&mdash;the trampling and neighing of
      horses without the gate&mdash;the flashing of arms, and rustling of
      plumes, and jingling of spurs, within it. In short, it was that gay and
      splendid confusion, in which the eye of youth sees all that is brave and
      brilliant, and that of experience much that is doubtful, deceitful, false,
      and hollow&mdash;hopes that will never be gratified&mdash;promises which
      will never be fulfilled&mdash;pride in the disguise of humility&mdash;and
      insolence in that of frank and generous bounty.

    <p>
      As, tired of the eager and enraptured attention which the page gave to a
      scene so new to him, Adam Woodcock endeavoured to get him to move forward,
      before his exuberance of astonishment should attract the observation of
      the sharp-witted denizens of the court, the falconer himself became an
      object of attention to a gay menial in a dark-green bonnet and feather,
      with a cloak of a corresponding colour, laid down, as the phrase then
      went, by six broad bars of silver lace, and welted with violet and silver.
      The words of recognition burst from both at once. &ldquo;What! Adam Woodcock at
      court!&rdquo; and &ldquo;What! Michael Wing-the-wind&mdash;and how runs the hackit
      greyhound bitch now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waur for the wear, like ourselves, Adam&mdash;eight years this grass&mdash;no
      four legs will carry a dog forever; but we keep her for the breed, and so
      she 'scapes Border doom&mdash;But why stand you gazing there? I promise
      you my lord has wished for you, and asked for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord of Murray asked for me, and he Regent of the kingdom too!&rdquo; said
      Adam. &ldquo;I hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my good lord;&mdash;but I
      fancy his good lordship remembers the day's sport on Carnwath-moor; and my
      Drummelzier falcon, that beat the hawks from the Isle of Man, and won his
      lordship a hundred crowns from the Southern baron whom they called
      Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, not to flatter thee, Adam,&rdquo; said his court-friend, &ldquo;he remembers
      nought of thee, or of thy falcon either. He hath flown many a higher
      flight since that, and struck his quarry too. But come, come hither away;
      I trust we are to be good comrades on the old score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;you would have me crush a pot with you; but I must
      first dispose of my eyas, where he will neither have girl to chase, nor
      lad to draw sword upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the youngster such a one?&rdquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, by my hood, he flies at all game,&rdquo; replied Woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then had he better come with us,&rdquo; said Michael Wing-the-wind; &ldquo;for we
      cannot have a proper carouse just now, only I would wet my lips, and so
      must you. I want to hear the news from Saint Mary's before you see my
      lord, and I will let you know how the wind sits up yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he thus spoke, he led the way to a side door which opened into the
      court; and threading several dark passages with the air of one who knew
      the most secret recesses of the palace, conducted them to a small matted
      chamber, where he placed bread and cheese and a foaming flagon of ale
      before the falconer and his young companion, who immediately did justice
      to the latter in a hearty draught, which nearly emptied the measure.
      Having drawn his breath, and dashed the froth from his whiskers, he
      observed, that his anxiety for the boy had made him deadly dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mend your draught,&rdquo; said his hospitable friend, again supplying the
      flagon from a pitcher which stood beside. &ldquo;I know the way to the
      butterybar. And now, mind what I say&mdash;this morning the Earl of Morton
      came to my lord in a mighty chafe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! they keep the old friendship, then?&rdquo; said Woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, man, what else?&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;one hand must scratch the other.
      But in a mighty chafe was my Lord of Morton, who, to say truth, looketh on
      such occasions altogether uncanny, and, as it were, fiendish; and he says
      to my lord,&mdash;for I was in the chamber taking orders about a cast of
      hawks that are to be fetched from Darnoway&mdash;they match your
      long-winged falcons, friend Adam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will believe that when I see them fly as high a pitch,&rdquo; replied
      Woodcock, this professional observation forming a sort of parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Michael, pursuing his tale, &ldquo;my Lord of Morton, in a
      mighty chafe, asked my Lord Regent whether he was well dealt with&mdash;'for
      my brother,' said he, 'should have had a gift to be Commendator of
      Kennaqubair, and to have all the temporalities erected into a lordship of
      regality for his benefit; and here,' said he, 'the false monks have had
      the insolence to choose a new Abbot to put his claim in my brother's way;
      and moreover, the rascality of the neighbourhood have burnt and plundered
      all that was left in the Abbey, so that my brother will not have a house
      to dwell in, when he hath ousted the lazy hounds of priests.' And my lord,
      seeing him chafed, said mildly to him, 'These are shrewd tidings, Douglas,
      but I trust they be not true; for Halbert Glendinning went southward
      yesterday, with a band of spears, and assuredly, had either of these
      chances happened, that the monks had presumed to choose an Abbot, or that
      the Abbey had been burnt, as you say, he had taken order on the spot for
      the punishment of such insolence, and had despatched us a messenger.' And
      the Earl of Morton replied&mdash;now I pray you, Adam, to notice, that I
      say this out of love to you and your lord, and also for old comradeship,
      and also because Sir Halbert hath done me good, and may again&mdash;and
      also because I love not the Earl of Morton, as indeed more fear than like
      him&mdash;so then it were a foul deed in you to betray me.&mdash;'But,'
      said the Earl to the Regent, 'take heed, my lord, you trust not this
      Glendinning too far&mdash;he comes of churl's blood, which was never true
      to the nobles'&mdash;by Saint Andrew, these were his very words.&mdash;'And
      besides,' he said, 'he hath a brother, a monk in Saint Mary's, and walks
      all by his guidance, and is making friends on the Border with Buccleuch
      and with Ferniehirst, [Footnote: Both these Border Chieftains were great
      friends of Queen Mary.] and will join hand with them, were there
      likelihood of a new world.' And my lord answered, like a free noble lord
      as he is; 'Tush! my Lord of Morton, I will be warrant for Glendinning's
      faith; and for his brother, he is a dreamer, that thinks of nought but
      book and breviary&mdash;and if such hap have chanced as you tell of, I
      look to receive from Glendinning the cowl of a hanged monk, and the head
      of a riotous churl, by way of sharp and sudden justice.'&mdash;And my Lord
      of Morton left the place, and, as it seemed to me, somewhat malecontent.
      But since that time, my lord has asked me more than once whether there has
      arrived no messenger from the Knight of Avenel. And all this I have told
      you, that you may frame your discourse to the best purpose, for it seems
      to me that my lord will not be well-pleased, if aught has happened like
      what my Lord of Morton said, and if your lord hath not ta'en strict orders
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this communication which fairly blanked the bold
      visage of Adam Woodcock, in spite of the reinforcement which his natural
      hardihood had received from the berry-brown ale of Holyrood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it he said about a churl's head, that grim Lord of Morton?&rdquo; said
      the discontented falconer to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it was my Lord Regent, who said that he expected, if the Abbey was
      injured, your Knight would send him the head of the ringleader among the
      rioters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but is this done like a good Protestant,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;or a
      true Lord of the Congregation? We used to be their white-boys and darlings
      when we pulled down the convents in Fife and Perthshire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, but that,&rdquo;
       said Michael, &ldquo;was when old mother Rome held her own, and our great folks
      were determined she should have no shelter for her head in Scotland. But,
      now that the priests are fled in all quarters, and their houses and lands
      are given to our grandees, they cannot see that we are working the work of
      reformation in destroying the palaces of zealous Protestants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you Saint Mary's is not destroyed!&rdquo; said Woodcock, in
      increasing agitation; &ldquo;some trash of painted windows there were broken&mdash;things
      that no nobleman could have brooked in his house&mdash;some stone saints
      were brought on their marrow-bones, like old Widdrington at Chevy-Chase;
      but as for fire-raising, there was not so much as a lighted lunt amongst
      us, save the match which the dragon had to light the burning tow withal,
      which he was to spit against Saint George; nay, I had caution of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! Adam Woodcock,&rdquo; said his comrade, &ldquo;I trust thou hadst no hand in
      such a fair work? Look you, Adam, I were loth to terrify you, and you just
      come from a journey; but I promise you, Earl Morton hath brought you down
      a Maiden from Halifax, you never saw the like of her&mdash;and she'll
      clasp you round the neck, and your head will remain in her arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered Adam, &ldquo;I am too old to have my head turned by any maiden
      of them all. I know my Lord of Morton will go as far for a buxom lass as
      anyone; but what the devil took him to Halifax all the way? and if he has
      got a gamester there, what hath she to do with my head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much, much!&rdquo; answered Michael. &ldquo;Herod's daughter, who did such execution
      with her foot and ankle, danced not men's heads off more cleanly than this
      maiden of Morton. [Footnote: Maiden of Morton&mdash;a species of
      Guillotine which the Regent Morton brought down from Halifax, certainly at
      a period considerably later than intimated in the tale. He was himself the
      first who suffered by the engine.] 'Tis an axe, man,&mdash;an axe which
      falls of itself like a sash window, and never gives the headsmen the
      trouble to wield it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith, a shrewd device,&rdquo; said Woodcock; &ldquo;heaven keep us free on't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page, seeing no end to the conversation betwixt these two old
      comrades, and anxious from what he had heard, concerning the fate of the
      Abbot, now interrupted their conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Adam Woodcock, thou hadst better deliver thy
      master's letter to the Regent; questionless he hath therein stated what
      has chanced at Kennaquhair, in the way most advantageous for all
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy is right,&rdquo; said Michael Wing-the-wind, &ldquo;my lord will be very
      impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child hath wit enough to keep himself warm,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock,
      producing from his hawking-bag his lord's letter, addressed to the Earl of
      Murray, &ldquo;and for that matter so have I. So, Master Roland, you will e'en
      please to present this yourself to the Lord Regent; his presence will be
      better graced by a young page than by an old falconer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, canny Yorkshire!&rdquo; replied his friend; &ldquo;and but now you were so
      earnest to see our good lord!&mdash;Why, wouldst thou put the lad into the
      noose that thou mayst slip tether thyself?&mdash;or dost thou think the
      maiden will clasp his fair young neck more willingly than thy old sunburnt
      weasand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; answered the falconer; &ldquo;thy wit towers high an it could strike
      the quarry. I tell thee, the youth has nought to fear&mdash;he had nothing
      to do with the gambol&mdash;a rare gambol it was, Michael, as mad-caps
      ever played; and I had made as rare a ballad, if we had had the luck to
      get it sung to an end. But mum for that&mdash;<i>tace</i>, as I said
      before, is Latin for a candle. Carry the youth to the presence, and I will
      remain here, with bridle in hand, ready to strike the spurs up to the
      rowel-heads, in case the hawk flies my way.&mdash;I will soon put
      Soltraedge, I trow, betwixt the Regent and me, if he means me less than
      fair play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on then, my lad,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;since thou must needs take the
      spring before canny Yorkshire.&rdquo; So saying, he led the way through winding
      passages, closely followed by Roland Graeme, until they arrived at a large
      winding stone stair, the steps of which were so long and broad, and at the
      same time so low, as to render the ascent uncommonly easy. When they had
      ascended about the height of one story, the guide stepped aside, and
      pushed open the door of a dark and gloomy antechamber; so dark, indeed,
      that his youthful companion stumbled, and nearly fell down upon a low
      step, which was awkwardly placed on the very threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take heed,&rdquo; said Michael Wing-the-wind, in a very low tone of voice, and
      first glancing cautiously round to see if any one listened&mdash;&ldquo;Take
      heed, my young friend, for those who fall on these boards seldom rise
      again&mdash;Seest thou that,&rdquo; he added, in a still lower voice, pointing
      to some dark crimson stains on the floor, on which a ray of light, shot
      through a small aperture, and traversing the general gloom of the
      apartment, fell with mottled radiance&mdash;&ldquo;Seest thou that, youth?&mdash;walk
      warily, for men have fallen here before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean you?&rdquo; said the page, his flesh creeping, though he scarce knew
      why; &ldquo;Is it blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the domestic, in the same whispering tone, and dragging the
      youth on by the arm&mdash;&ldquo;Blood it is,&mdash;but this is no time to
      question, or even to look at it. Blood it is, foully and fearfully shed,
      as foully and fearfully avenged. The blood,&rdquo; he added, in a still more
      cautious tone, &ldquo;of Seignior David.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme's heart throbbed when he found himself so unexpectedly in
      the scene of Rizzio's slaughter, a catastrophe which had chilled with
      horror all even in that rude age, which had been the theme of wonder and
      pity through every cottage and castle in Scotland, and had not escaped
      that of Avenel. But his guide hurried him forward, permitting no farther
      question, and with the manner of one who has already tampered too much
      with a dangerous subject. A tap which he made at a low door at one end of
      the vestibule, was answered by a huissier or usher, who, opening it
      cautiously, received Michael's intimation that a page waited the Regent's
      leisure, who brought letters from the Knight of Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Council is breaking up,&rdquo; said the usher; &ldquo;but give me the packet; his
      Grace the Regent will presently see the messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The packet,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;must be delivered into the Regent's own
      hands; such were the orders of my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The usher looked at him from head to foot, as if surprised at his
      boldness, and then replied, with some asperity, &ldquo;Say you so, my young
      master? Thou crowest loudly to be but a chicken, and from a country
      barn-yard too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it a time or place,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;thou shouldst see I can do more
      than crow; but do your duty, and let the Regent know I wait his pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art but a pert knave to tell me of my duty,&rdquo; said the courtier in
      office; &ldquo;but I will find a time to show you you are out of yours;
      meanwhile, wait there till you are wanted.&rdquo; So saying, he shut the door in
      Roland's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Wing-the-wind, who had shrunk from his youthful companion during
      this altercation, according to the established maxim of courtiers of all
      ranks, and in all ages, now transgressed their prudential line of conduct
      so far as to come up to him once more. &ldquo;Thou art a hopeful young
      springald,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I see right well old Yorkshire had reason in his
      caution. Thou hast been five minutes in the court, and hast employed thy
      time so well, as to make a powerful and a mortal enemy out of the usher of
      the council-chamber. Why, man, you might almost as well have offended the
      deputy butler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not what he is,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;I will teach whomever I
      speak with to speak civilly to me in return. I did not come from Avenel to
      be browbeaten in Holyrood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, my lad!&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;it is a fine spirit if you can but hold it&mdash;but
      see, the door opens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The usher appeared, and, in a more civil tone of voice and manner, said,
      that his Grace the Regent would receive the Knight of Avenel's message;
      and accordingly marshalled Roland Graeme the way into the apartment, from
      which the Council had been just dismissed, after finishing their
      consultations. There was in the room a long oaken table, surrounded by
      stools of the same wood, with a large elbow chair, covered with crimson
      velvet, at the head. Writing materials and papers were lying there in
      apparent disorder; and one or two of the privy counsellors who had
      lingered behind, assuming their cloaks, bonnets, and swords, and bidding
      farewell to the Regent, were departing slowly by a large door, on the
      opposite side to that through which the page entered. Apparently the Earl
      of Murray had made some jest, for the smiling countenances of the
      statesmen expressed that sort of cordial reception which is paid by
      courtiers to the condescending pleasantries of a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Regent himself was laughing heartily as he said, &ldquo;Farewell, my lords,
      and hold me remembered to the Cock of the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then turned slowly round towards Roland Graeme, and the marks of
      gaiety, real or assumed, disappeared from his countenance, as completely
      as the passing bubbles leave the dark mirror of a still profound lake into
      which a traveller has cast a stone; in the course of a minute his noble
      features had assumed their natural expression of deep and even melancholy
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This distinguished statesman, for as such his worst enemies acknowledged
      him, possessed all the external dignity, as well as almost all the noble
      qualities, which could grace the power that he enjoyed; and had he
      succeeded to the throne as his legitimate inheritance, it is probable he
      would have been recorded as one of Scotland's wisest and greatest kings.
      But that he held his authority by the deposition and imprisonment of his
      sister and benefactress, was a crime which those only can excuse who think
      ambition an apology for ingratitude. He was dressed plainly in black
      velvet, after the Flemish fashion, and wore in his high-crowned hat a
      jewelled clasp, which looped it up on one side, and formed the only
      ornament of his apparel. He had his poniard by his side, and his sword lay
      on the council table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the personage before whom Roland Graeme now presented himself,
      with a feeling of breathless awe, very different from the usual boldness
      and vivacity of his temper. In fact, he was, from education and nature,
      forward, but not impudent, and was much more easily controlled by the
      moral superiority, arising from the elevated talents and renown of those
      with whom he conversed, than by pretensions founded only on rank or
      external show. He might have braved with indifference the presence of an
      earl, merely distinguished by his belt and coronet; but he felt overawed
      in that of the eminent soldier and statesman, the wielder of a nation's
      power, and the leader of her armies.&mdash;The greatest and wisest are
      flattered by the deference of youth&mdash;so graceful and becoming in
      itself; and Murray took, with much courtesy, the letter from the hands of
      the abashed and blushing page, and answered with complaisance to the
      imperfect and half-muttered greeting, which he endeavoured to deliver to
      him on the part of Sir Halbert of Avenel. He even paused a moment ere he
      broke the silk with which the letter was secured, to ask the page his name&mdash;so
      much he was struck with his very handsome features and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roland Graeme,&rdquo; he said, repeating the words after the hesitating page.
      &ldquo;What! of the Grahams of the Lennox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; replied Roland; &ldquo;my parents dwelt in the Debateable Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murray made no further inquiry, but proceeded to read his dispatches;
      during the perusal of which his brow began to assume a stern expression of
      displeasure, as that of one who found something which at once surprised
      and disturbed him. He sat down on the nearest seat, frowned till his
      eyebrows almost met together, read the letter twice over, and was then
      silent for several minutes. At length, raising his head, his eye
      encountered that of the usher, who in vain endeavoured to exchange the
      look of eager and curious observation with which he had been perusing the
      Regent's features, for that open and unnoticing expression of countenance,
      which, in looking at all, seems as if it saw and marked nothing&mdash;a
      cast of look which may be practised with advantage by all those, of
      whatever degree, who are admitted to witness the familiar and unguarded
      hours of their superiors. Great men are as jealous of their thoughts as
      the wife of King Candaules was of her charms, and will as readily punish
      those who have, however involuntarily, beheld them in mental deshabille
      and exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the apartment, Hyndman,&rdquo; said the Regent, sternly, &ldquo;and carry your
      observation elsewhere. You are too knowing, sir, for your post, which, by
      special order, is destined for men of blunter capacity. So! now you look
      more like a fool than you did,&rdquo;&mdash;(for Hyndman, as may easily be
      supposed, was not a little disconcerted by this rebuke)&mdash;&ldquo;keep that
      confused stare, and it may keep your office. Begone, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The usher departed in dismay, not forgetting to register, amongst his
      other causes of dislike to Roland Graeme, that he had been the witness of
      this disgraceful chiding. When he had left the apartment, the Regent again
      addressed the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, you say, is Armstrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Roland, &ldquo;my name is Graeme, so please you&mdash;Roland
      Graeme, whose forbears were designated of Heathergill, in the Debateable
      Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I knew it was a name from the Debateable Land. Hast thou any
      acquaintance in Edinburgh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied Roland, willing rather to evade this question than to
      answer it directly, for the prudence of being silent with respect to Lord
      Seyton's adventure immediately struck him, &ldquo;I have been in Edinburgh
      scarce an hour, and that for the first time in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and thou Sir Halbert Glendinning's page?&rdquo; said the Regent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was brought up as my Lady's page,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and left Avenel
      Castle for the first time in my life&mdash;at least since my childhood&mdash;only
      three days since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lady's page!&rdquo; repeated the Earl of Murray, as if speaking to himself;
      &ldquo;it was strange to send his Lady's page on a matter of such deep
      concernment&mdash;Morton will say it is of a piece with the nomination of
      his brother to be Abbot; and yet in some sort an inexperienced youth will
      best serve the turn.&mdash;What hast thou been taught, young man, in thy
      doughty apprenticeship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hunt, my lord, and to hawk,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hunt coneys, and to hawk at ouzels!&rdquo; said the Regent, smiling; &ldquo;for
      such are the sports of ladies and their followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Graeme's cheek reddened deeply as he replied, not without some emphasis,
      &ldquo;To hunt red-deer of the first head, and to strike down herons of the
      highest soar, my lord, which, in Lothian speech, may be termed, for aught
      I know, coneys and ouzels;-also I can wield a brand and couch a lance,
      according to our Border meaning; in inland speech these may be termed
      water-flags and bulrushes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy speech rings like metal,&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;and I pardon the
      sharpness of it for the truth.&mdash;Thou knowest, then, what belongs to
      the duty of a man-at-arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as exercise can teach&mdash;it without real service in the field,&rdquo;
       answered Roland Graeme; &ldquo;but our Knight permitted none of his household to
      make raids, and I never had the good fortune to see a stricken field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good fortune!&rdquo; repeated the Regent, smiling somewhat sorrowfully,
      &ldquo;take my word, young man, war is the only game from which both parties
      rise losers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, my lord!&rdquo; answered the page, with his characteristic
      audacity, &ldquo;if fame speaks truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; said the Regent, colouring in his turn, and perhaps suspecting
      an indiscreet allusion to the height which he himself had attained by the
      hap of civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, my lord,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, without change of tone, &ldquo;he who
      fights well, must have fame in life, or honour in death; and so war is a
      game from which no one can rise a loser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Regent smiled and shook his head, when at that moment the door opened,
      and the Earl of Morton presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come somewhat hastily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I enter unannounced because my
      news are of weight&mdash;It is as I said; Edward Glendinning is named
      Abbot, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my lord!&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;I know it, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps you knew it before I did, my Lord of Murray,&rdquo; answered
      Morton, his dark red brow growing darker and redder as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton,&rdquo; said Murray, &ldquo;suspect me not&mdash;touch not mine honour&mdash;I
      have to suffer enough from the calumnies of foes, let me not have to
      contend with the unjust suspicions of my friends.&mdash;We are not alone,&rdquo;
       said he, recollecting himself, &ldquo;or I could tell you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led Morton into one of the deep embrasures which the windows formed in
      the massive wall, and which afforded a retiring place for their conversing
      apart. In this recess, Roland observed them speak together with much
      earnestness, Murray appearing to be grave and earnest, and Morton having a
      jealous and offended air, which seemed gradually to give way to the
      assurances of the Regent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their conversation grew more earnest, they became gradually louder in
      speech, having perhaps forgotten the presence of the page, the more
      readily as his position in the apartment placed him put of sight, so that
      he found himself unwillingly privy to more of their discourse than he
      cared to hear. For, page though he was, a mean curiosity after the secrets
      of others had never been numbered amongst Roland's failings; and moreover,
      with all his natural rashness, he could not but doubt the safety of
      becoming privy to the secret discourse of these powerful and dreaded men.
      Still he could neither stop his ears, nor with propriety leave the
      apartment; and while he thought of some means of signifying his presence,
      he had already heard so much, that, to have produced himself suddenly
      would have been as awkward, and perhaps as dangerous, as in quiet to abide
      the end of their conference. What he overheard, however, was but an
      imperfect part of their communication; and although an expert politician,
      acquainted with the circumstances of the times, would have had little
      difficulty in tracing the meaning, yet Roland Graeme could only form very
      general and vague conjectures as to the import of their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is prepared,&rdquo; said Murray, &ldquo;and Lindsay is setting forward&mdash;She
      must hesitate no longer&mdash;thou seest I act by thy counsel, and harden
      myself against softer considerations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, my lord,&rdquo; replied Morton, &ldquo;in what is necessary to gain power, you
      do not hesitate, but go boldly to the mark. But are you as careful to
      defend and preserve what you have won?&mdash;Why this establishment of
      domestics around her?&mdash;has not your sister men and maidens enough to
      tend her, but you must consent to this superfluous and dangerous retinue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Morton!&mdash;a Princess, and my sister, could I do less than
      allow her due attendance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied Morton, &ldquo;even thus fly all your shafts&mdash;smartly enough
      loosened from the bow, and not unskilfully aimed&mdash;but a breath of
      foolish affection ever crosses in the mid volley, and sways the arrow from
      the mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say not so, Morton,&rdquo; replied Murray, &ldquo;I have both dared and done&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, enough to gain, but not enough to keep&mdash;reckon not that she
      will think and act thus&mdash;you have wounded her deeply, both in pride
      and in power&mdash;it signifies nought, that you would tent now the wound
      with unavailing salves&mdash;as matters stand with you, you must forfeit
      the title of an affectionate brother, to hold that of a bold and
      determined statesman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton!&rdquo; said Murray, with some impatience, &ldquo;I brook not these taunts&mdash;what
      I have done I have done&mdash;what I must farther do, I must and will&mdash;but
      I am not made of iron like thee, and I cannot but remember&mdash;Enough of
      this-my purpose holds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I warrant me,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;the choice of these domestic
      consolations will rest with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he whispered names which escaped Roland Graeme's ear. Murray replied
      in a similar tone, but so much raised towards the conclusion, of the
      sentence, that the page heard these words&mdash;&ldquo;And of him I hold myself
      secure, by Glendinning's recommendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, which may be as much trustworthy as his late conduct at the Abbey of
      Saint Mary's&mdash;you have heard that his brother's election has taken
      place. Your favourite Sir Halbert, my Lord of Murray, has as much
      fraternal affection as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven, Morton, that taunt demanded an unfriendly answer, but I pardon
      it, for your brother also is concerned; but this election shall be
      annulled. I tell you, Earl of Morton, while I hold the sword of state in
      my royal nephew's name, neither Lord nor Knight in Scotland shall dispute
      my authority; and if I bear&mdash;with insults from my friends, it is only
      while I know them to be such, and forgive their follies for their
      faithfulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton muttered what seemed to be some excuse, and the Regent answered him
      in a milder tone, and then subjoined, &ldquo;Besides, I have another pledge than
      Glendinning's recommendation, for this youth's fidelity&mdash;his nearest
      relative has placed herself in my hands as his security, to be dealt
      withal as his doings shall deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is something,&rdquo; replied Morton; &ldquo;but yet in fair love and goodwill, I
      must still pray you to keep on your guard. The foes are stirring again, as
      horse-flies and hornets become busy so soon as the storm-blast is over.
      George of Seyton was crossing the causeway this morning with a score of
      men at his back, and had a ruffle with my friends of the house of Leslie&mdash;they
      met at the Tron, and were fighting hard, when the provost, with his guard
      of partisans, came in thirdsman, and staved them asunder with their
      halberds, as men part dog and bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hath my order for such interference,&rdquo; said the Regent&mdash;&ldquo;Has any
      one been hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George of Seyton himself, by black Ralph Leslie&mdash;the devil take the
      rapier that ran not through from side to side! Ralph has a bloody coxcomb,
      by a blow from a messan-page whom nobody knew&mdash;Dick Seyton of
      Windygowl is run through the arm, and two gallants of the Leslies have
      suffered phlebotomy. This is all the gentle blood which has been spilled
      in the revel; but a yeoman or two on both sides have had bones broken and
      ears chopped. The ostlere-wives, who are like to be the only losers by
      their miscarriage, have dragged the knaves off the street, and are crying
      a drunken coronach over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take it lightly, Douglas,&rdquo; said the Regent; &ldquo;these broils and feuds
      would shame the capital of the great Turk, let alone that of a Christian
      and reformed state. But, if I live, this gear shall be amended; and men
      shall say, when they read my story, that if it were my cruel hap to rise
      to power by the dethronement of a sister, I employed it, when gained, for
      the benefit of the commonweal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of your friends,&rdquo; replied Morton; &ldquo;wherefore I trust for your instant
      order annulling the election of this lurdane Abbot, Edward Glendinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be presently satisfied.&rdquo; said the Regent; and stepping forward,
      he began to call, &ldquo;So ho, Hyndman!&rdquo; when suddenly his eye lighted on
      Roland Graeme&mdash;&ldquo;By my faith, Douglas,&rdquo; said he, turning to his
      friend, &ldquo;here have been three at counsel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but only two can keep counsel,&rdquo; said Morton; &ldquo;the galliard must be
      disposed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Morton&mdash;an orphan boy!&mdash;Hearken thee, my child&mdash;Thou
      hast told me some of thy accomplishments&mdash;canst thou speak truth?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Ay, my lord, when it serves my turn,&rdquo; replied Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall serve thy turn now,&rdquo; said the Regent; &ldquo;and falsehood shall be
      thy destruction. How much hast thou heard or understood of what we two
      have spoken together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But little, my lord,&rdquo; replied Roland Graeme boldly, &ldquo;which met my
      apprehension, saving that it seemed to me as if in something you doubted
      the faith of the Knight of Avenel, under whose roof I was nurtured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what hast thou to say on that point, young man?&rdquo; continued the
      Regent, bending his eyes upon him with a keen and strong expression of
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;depends on the quality of those who speak against
      his honour whose bread I have long eaten. If they be my inferiors, I say
      they lie, and will maintain what I say with my baton; if my equals, still
      I say they lie, and will do battle in the quarrel, if they list, with my
      sword; if my superiors&rdquo;&mdash;he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed boldly,&rdquo; said the Regent&mdash;&ldquo;What if thy superiors said aught
      that nearly touched your master's honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say,&rdquo; replied Graeme, &ldquo;that he did ill to slander the absent, and
      that my master was a man who could render an account of his actions to any
      one who should manfully demand it of him to his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it were manfully said,&rdquo; replied the Regent&mdash;&ldquo;what thinkest thou,
      my Lord of Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Morton, &ldquo;that if the young galliard resemble a certain
      ancient friend of ours, as much in the craft of his disposition as he does
      in eye and in brow, there may be a wide difference betwixt what he means
      and what he speaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom meanest thou that he resembles so closely?&rdquo; said Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the true and trusty Julian Avenel,&rdquo; replied Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this youth belongs to the Debateable Land,&rdquo; said Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so; but Julian was an outlaying striker of venison, and made
      many a far cast when he had a fair doe in chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;this is but idle talk&mdash;Here, thou Hyndman&mdash;thou
      curiosity,&rdquo; calling to the usher, who now entered,&mdash;&ldquo;conduct this
      youth to his companion&mdash;You will both,&rdquo; he said to Graeme, &ldquo;keep
      yourselves in readiness to travel on short notice.&rdquo;&mdash;And then
      motioning to him courteously to withdraw, he broke up the interview.

      Chapter the Nineteenth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  It is and is not&mdash;'tis the thing I sought for,
  Have kneel'd for, pray'd for, risk'd my fame and life for,
  And yet it is not&mdash;no more than the shadow
  Upon the hard, cold, flat, and polished mirror,
  Is the warm, graceful, rounded, living substance
  Which it presents in form and lineament.
                                     OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      The usher, with gravity which ill concealed a jealous scowl, conducted
      Roland Graeme to a lower apartment, where he found his comrade the
      falconer. The man of office then briefly acquainted them that this would
      be their residence till his Grace's farther orders; that they were to go
      to the pantry, to the buttery, to the cellar, and to the kitchen, at the
      usual hours, to receive the allowances becoming their station,&mdash;instructions
      which Adam Woodcock's old familiarity with the court made him perfectly
      understand&mdash;&ldquo;For your beds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must go to the hostelry of
      Saint Michael's, in respect the palace is now full of the domestics of the
      greater nobles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the usher's back turned than Adam exclaimed with all the
      glee of eager curiosity, &ldquo;And now, Master Roland, the news&mdash;the news&mdash;come
      unbutton thy pouch, and give us thy tidings&mdash;What says the Regent?
      asks he for Adam Woodcock?&mdash;and is all soldered up, or must the Abbot
      of Unreason strap for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well in that quarter,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;and for the rest&mdash;But,
      hey-day, what! have you taken the chain and medal off from my bonnet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meet time it was, when yon usher, vinegar-faced rogue that he is,
      began to inquire what Popish trangam you were wearing.&mdash;By the mass,
      the metal would have been confiscated for conscience-sake, like your other
      rattle-trap yonder at Avenel, which Mistress Lilias bears about on her
      shoes in the guise of a pair of shoe-buckles&mdash;This comes of carrying
      Popish nicknackets about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jade!&rdquo; exclaimed Roland Graeme, &ldquo;has she melted down my rosary into
      buckles for her clumsy hoofs, which will set off such a garnish nearly as
      well as a cow's might?&mdash;But, hang her, let her keep them&mdash;many a
      dog's trick have I played old Lilias, for want of having something better
      to do, and the buckles will serve for a remembrance. Do you remember the
      verjuice I put into the comfits, when old Wingate and she were to
      breakfast together on Easter morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In troth do I, Master Roland&mdash;the major-domo's mouth was as crooked
      as a hawk's beak for the whole morning afterwards, and any other page in
      your room would have tasted the discipline of the porter's lodge for it.
      But my Lady's favour stood between your skin and many a jerking&mdash;Lord
      send you may be the better for her protection in such matters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am least grateful for it, Adam! and I am glad you put me in mind of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but the news, my young master,&rdquo; said Woodcock, &ldquo;spell me the
      tidings&mdash;what are we to fly at next?&mdash;what did the Regent say to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that I am to repeat again,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hey-day,&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;how prudent we are become all of a sudden! You
      have advanced rarely in brief space, Master Roland. You have well nigh had
      your head broken, and you have gained your gold chain, and you have made
      an enemy, Master Usher to wit, with his two legs like hawks' perches, and
      you have had audience of the first man in the realm, and bear as much
      mystery in your brow, as if you had flown in the court-sky ever since you
      were hatched. I believe, in my soul, you would run with a piece of the
      egg-shell on your head like the curlews, which (I would we were after them
      again) we used to call whaups in the Halidome and its neighbourhood. But
      sit thee down, boy; Adam Woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter into
      forbidden secrets&mdash;sit thee down, and I will go and fetch the vivers&mdash;I
      know the butler and the pantler of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured falconer set forth upon his errand, busying himself about
      procuring their refreshment; and, during his absence, Roland Graeme
      abandoned himself to the strange, complicated, and yet heart-stirring
      reflections, to which the events of the morning had given rise. Yesterday
      he was of neither mark nor likelihood; a vagrant boy, the attendant on a
      relative, of whose sane judgment he himself had not the highest opinion;
      but now he had become, he knew not why, or wherefore, or to what extent,
      the custodier, as the Scottish phrase went, of some important state
      secret, in the safe keeping of which the Regent himself was concerned. It
      did not diminish from, but rather added to the interest of a situation so
      unexpected, that Roland himself did not perfectly understand wherein he
      stood committed by the state secrets, in which he had unwittingly become
      participator. On the contrary, he felt like one who looks on a romantic
      landscape, of which he sees the features for the first time, and then
      obscured with mist and driving tempest. The imperfect glimpse which the
      eye catches of rocks, trees, and other objects around him, adds double
      dignity to these shrouded mountains and darkened abysses, of which the
      height, depth, and extent, are left to imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But mortals, especially at the well-appetized age which precedes twenty
      years, are seldom so much engaged either by real or conjectural subjects
      of speculation, but that their earthly wants claim their hour of
      attention. And with many a smile did our hero, so the reader may term him
      if he will, hail the re-appearance of his friend Adam Woodcock, bearing on
      one platter a tremendous portion of boiled beef, and on another a
      plentiful allowance of greens, or rather what the Scotch call lang-kale. A
      groom followed with bread, salt, and the other means of setting forth a
      meal; and when they had both placed on the oaken table what they bore in
      their hands, the falconer observed, that since he knew the court, it had
      got harder and harder every day to the poor gentlemen and yeoman
      retainers, but that now it was an absolute flaying of a flea for the hide
      and tallow. Such thronging to the wicket, and such churlish answers, and
      such bare beef-bones, such a shouldering at the buttery-hatch and
      cellarage, and nought to be gained beyond small insufficient single ale,
      or at best with a single straike of malt to counterbalance a double
      allowance of water&mdash;&ldquo;By the mass, though, my young friend,&rdquo; said he,
      while he saw the food disappearing fast under Roland's active exertions,
      &ldquo;it is not so to well to lament for former times as to take the advantage
      of the present, else we are like to lose on both sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Adam Woodcock drew his chair towards the table, unsheathed his
      knife, (for every one carried that minister of festive distribution for
      himself,) and imitated his young companion's example, who for the moment
      had lost his anxiety for the future in the eager satisfaction of an
      appetite sharpened by youth and abstinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, they made, though the materials were sufficiently simple, a very
      respectable meal, at the expense of the royal allowance; and Adam
      Woodcock, notwithstanding the deliberate censure which he had passed on
      the household beer of the palace, had taken the fourth deep draught of the
      black jack ere he remembered him that he had spoken in its dispraise.
      Flinging himself jollily and luxuriously back in an old danske
      elbow-chair, and looking with careless glee towards the page, extending at
      the same time his right leg, and stretching the other easily over it, he
      reminded his companion that he had not yet heard the ballad which he had
      made for the Abbot of Unreason's revel. And accordingly he struck merrily
      up with
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Pope, that pagan full of pride,
   Has blinded us full lang.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme, who felt no great delight, as may be supposed, in the
      falconer's satire, considering its subject, began to snatch up his mantle,
      and fling it around his shoulders, an action which instantly interrupted
      the ditty of Adam Woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the vengeance are you going now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou restless boy?&mdash;Thou
      hast quicksilver in the veins of thee to a certainty, and canst no more
      abide any douce and sensible communing, than a hoodless hawk would keep
      perched on my wrist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Adam,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;if you must needs know, I am about to take
      a walk and look at this fair city. One may as well be still mewed up in
      the old castle of the lake, if one is to sit the live-long night between
      four walls, and hearken to old ballads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a new ballad&mdash;the Lord help thee!&rdquo; replied Adam, &ldquo;and that one
      of the best that ever was matched with a rousing chorus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I will hear it another day, when the rain is
      dashing against the windows, and there is neither steed stamping, nor spur
      jingling, nor feather waving in the neighbourhood to mar my marking it
      well. But, even now, I want to be in the world, and to look about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the never a stride shall you go without me,&rdquo; said the falconer,
      &ldquo;until the Regent shall take you whole and sound off my hand; and so, if
      you will, we may go to the hostelrie of Saint Michael's, and there you
      will see company enough, but through the casement, mark you me; for as to
      rambling through the street to seek Seytons and Leslies, and having a
      dozen holes drilled in your new jacket with rapier and poniard, I will
      yield no way to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the hostelrie of Saint Michael's, then, with all my heart,&rdquo; said the
      page; and they left the palace accordingly, rendered to the sentinels at
      the gate, who had now taken their posts for the evening, a strict account
      of their names and business, were dismissed through a small wicket of the
      close-barred portal, and soon reached the inn or hostelrie of Saint
      Michael, which stood in a large court-yard, off the main street, close
      under the descent of the Calton-hill. The place, wide, waste, and
      uncomfortable, resembled rather an Eastern caravansary, where men found
      shelter indeed, but were obliged to supply themselves with every thing
      else, than one of our modern inns;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Where not one comfort shall to those be lost,
  Who never ask, or never feel, the cost.
</pre>
    <p>
      But still, to the inexperienced eye of Roland Graeme, the bustle and
      confusion of this place of public resort, furnished excitement and
      amusement. In the large room, into which they had rather found their own
      way than been ushered by mine host, travellers and natives of the city
      entered and departed, met and greeted, gamed or drank together, forming
      the strongest contrast to the stern and monotonous order and silence with
      which matters were conducted in the well-ordered household of the Knight
      of Avenel. Altercation of every kind, from brawling to jesting, was going
      on amongst the groups around them, and yet the noise and mingled voices
      seemed to disturb no one and indeed to be noticed by no others than by
      those who composed the group to which the speaker belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer passed through the apartment to a projecting latticed window,
      which formed a sort of recess from the room itself; and having here
      ensconced himself and his companion, he called for some refreshments; and
      a tapster, after he had shouted for the twentieth time, accommodated him
      with the remains of a cold capon and a neat's tongue, together with a
      pewter stoup of weak French vin-de-pays. &ldquo;Fetch a stoup of brandy-wine,
      thou knave&mdash;We will be jolly to-night, Master Roland,&rdquo; said he, when
      he saw himself thus accommodated, &ldquo;and let care come to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Roland had eaten too lately to enjoy the good cheer; and feeling his
      curiosity much sharper than his appetite, he made it his choice to look
      out of the lattice, which overhung a large yard, surrounded by the stables
      of the hostelrie, and fed his eyes on the busy sight beneath, while Adam
      Woodcock, after he had compared his companion to the &ldquo;Laird of
      Macfarlane's geese, who liked their play better than their meat,&rdquo; disposed
      of his time with the aid of cup and trencher, occasionally humming the
      burden of his birth-strangled ballad, and beating time to it with his
      fingers on the little round table. In this exercise he was frequently
      interrupted by the exclamations of his companion, as he saw something new
      in the yard beneath, to attract and interest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a busy scene, for the number of gentlemen and nobles who were now
      crowded into the city, had filled all spare stables and places of public
      reception with their horses and military attendants. There were some score
      of yeomen, dressing their own or their masters' horses in the yard,
      whistling, singing, laughing, and upbraiding each other, in a style of wit
      which the good order of Avenel Castle rendered strange to Roland Graeme's
      ears. Others were busy repairing their own arms, or cleaning those of
      their masters. One fellow, having just bought a bundle of twenty spears,
      was sitting in a corner, employed in painting the white staves of the
      weapons with yellow and vermillion. Other lacqueys led large stag-hounds,
      or wolf-dogs, of noble race, carefully muzzled to prevent accidents to
      passengers. All came and went, mixed together and separated, under the
      delighted eye of the page, whose imagination had not even conceived a
      scene so gaily diversified with the objects he had most pleasure in
      beholding; so that he was perpetually breaking the quiet reverie of honest
      Woodcock, and the mental progress which he was making in his ditty, by
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Look here, Adam&mdash;look at the bonny bay horse&mdash;Saint
      Anthony, what, a gallant forehand he hath got!&mdash;and see the goodly
      gray, which yonder fellow in the frieze-jacket is dressing as awkwardly as
      if he had never touched aught but a cow&mdash;I would I were nigh him to
      teach him his trade!&mdash;And lo you, Adam, the gay Milan armour that the
      yeoman is scouring, all steel and silver, like our Knight's prime suit, of
      which old Wingate makes such account&mdash;And see to yonder pretty wench,
      Adam, who comes tripping through them all with her milk-pail&mdash;I
      warrant me she has had a long walk from the loaning; she has a stammel
      waistcoat, like your favourite Cicely Sunderland, Master Adam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my hood, lad,&rdquo; answered the falconer, &ldquo;it is well for thee thou wert
      brought up where grace grew. Even in the Castle of Avenel thou wert a
      wild-blood enough, but hadst thou been nurtured here, within a flight-shot
      of the Court, thou hadst been the veriest crack-hemp of a page that ever
      wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy side: truly, I wish it may end
      well with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but leave thy senseless humming and drumming, old Adam, and come to
      the window ere thou hast drenched thy senses in the pint-pot there. See
      here comes a merry minstrel with his crowd, and a wench with him, that
      dances with bells at her ankles; and see, the yeomen and pages leave their
      horses and the armour they were cleaning, and gather round, as is very
      natural, to hear the music. Come, old Adam, we will thither too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall call me cutt if I do go down,&rdquo; said Adam; &ldquo;you are near as good
      minstrelsy as the stroller can make, if you had but the grace to listen to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wench in the stammel waistcoat is stopping too, Adam&mdash;by
      heaven, they are going to dance! Frieze-jacket wants to dance with stammel
      waistcoat, but she is coy and recusant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly changing his tone of levity into one of deep interest and
      surprise, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Queen of Heaven! what is it that I see!&rdquo; and then
      remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sage Adam Woodcock, who was in a sort of languid degree amused with
      the page's exclamations, even while he professed to despise them, became
      at length rather desirous to set his tongue once more a-going, that he
      might enjoy the superiority afforded by his own intimate familiarity with
      all the circumstances which excited in his young companion's mind so much
      wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;what is it you do see, Master Roland, that
      you have become mute all of a sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Master Roland Graeme,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;it is manners in my
      country for a man to speak when he is spoken to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murrain is in the boy,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;he has stared out his
      eyes, and talked his tongue to pieces, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The falconer hastily drank off his can of wine, and came to Roland, who
      stood like a statue, with his eyes eagerly bent on the court-yard, though
      Adam Woodcock was unable to detect amongst the joyous scenes which it
      exhibited aught that could deserve such devoted attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad is mazed!&rdquo; said the falconer to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roland Graeme had good reasons for his surprise, though they were not
      such as he could communicate to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch of the old minstrel's instrument, for he had already begun to
      play, had drawn in several auditors from the street when one entered the
      gate of the yard, whose appearance exclusively arrested the attention of
      Roland Graeme. He was of his own age, or a good deal younger, and from his
      dress and bearing might be of the same rank and calling, having all the
      air of coxcombry and pretension, which accorded with a handsome, though
      slight and low figure, and an elegant dress, in part hid by a large purple
      cloak. As he entered, he cast a glance up towards the windows, and, to his
      extreme astonishment, under the purple velvet bonnet and white feather,
      Roland recognized the features so deeply impressed on his memory, the
      bright and clustered tresses, the laughing full blue eyes, the well-formed
      eyebrows, the nose, with the slightest possible inclination to be
      aquiline, the ruby lip, of which an arch and half-suppressed smile seemed
      the habitual expression&mdash;in short, the form and face of Catherine
      Seyton; in man's attire, however, and mimicking, as it seemed, not
      unsuccessfully, the bearing of a youthful but forward page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint George and Saint Andrew!&rdquo; exclaimed the amazed Roland Graeme to
      himself, &ldquo;was there ever such an audacious quean!&mdash;she seems a little
      ashamed of her mummery too, for she holds the lap of her cloak to her
      face, and her colour is heightened&mdash;but Santa Maria, how she threads
      the throng, with as firm and bold a step as if she had never tied
      petticoat round her waist!&mdash;Holy Saints! she holds up her riding-rod
      as if she would lay it about some of their ears, that stand most in her
      way&mdash;by the hand of my father! she bears herself like the very model
      of pagehood.&mdash;Hey! what! sure she will not strike frieze-jacket in
      earnest?&rdquo; But he was not long left in doubt; for the lout whom he had
      before repeatedly noticed, standing in the way of the bustling page, and
      maintaining his place with clownish obstinacy or stupidity, the advanced
      riding-rod was, without a moment's hesitation, sharply applied to his
      shoulders, in a manner which made him spring aside, rubbing the part of
      the body which had received so unceremonious a hint that it was in the way
      of his betters. The party injured growled forth an oath or two of
      indignation, and Roland Graeme began to think of flying down stairs to the
      assistance of the translated Catherine; but the laugh of the yard was
      against frieze-jacket, which indeed had, in those days, small chance of
      fair play in a quarrel with velvet and embroidery; so that the fellow, who
      was menial in the inn, slunk back to finish his task of dressing the bonny
      gray, laughed at by all, but most by the wench in the stammel waistcoat,
      his fellow-servant, who, to crown his disgrace, had the cruelty to cast an
      applauding smile upon the author of the injury, while, with a freedom more
      like the milk-maid of the town than she of the plains, she accosted him
      with&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any one you want here, my pretty gentleman, that you
      seem in such haste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek a sprig of a lad,&rdquo; said the seeming gallant, &ldquo;with a sprig of
      holly in his cap, black hair, and black eyes, green jacket, and the air of
      a country coxcomb&mdash;I have sought him through every close and alley in
      the Canongate, the fiend gore him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, God-a-mercy, Nun!&rdquo; muttered Roland Graeme, much bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will inquire him presently out for your fair young worship,&rdquo; said the
      wench of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said the gallant squire, &ldquo;and if you bring me to him, you shall have
      a groat to-night, and a kiss on Sunday when you have on a cleaner kirtle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, God-a-mercy, Nun!&rdquo; again muttered Roland, &ldquo;this is a note above E
      La.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment after, the servant entered the room, and ushered in the object
      of his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the disguised vestal looked with unabashed brow, and bold and rapid
      glance of her eye, through the various parties in the large old room,
      Roland Graeme, who felt an internal awkward sense of bashful confusion,
      which he deemed altogether unworthy of the bold and dashing character to
      which he aspired, determined not to be browbeaten and put down by this
      singular female, but to meet her with a glance of recognition so sly, so
      penetrating, so expressively humorous, as should show her at once he was
      in possession of her secret and master of her fate, and should compel her
      to humble herself towards him, at least into the look and manner of
      respectful and deprecating observance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was extremely well planned; but just as Roland had called up the
      knowing glance, the suppressed smile, the shrewd intelligent look, which
      was to ensure his triumph, he encountered the bold, firm, and steady gaze
      of his brother or sister-page, who, casting on him a falcon glance, and
      recognizing him at once as the object of his search, walked up with the
      most unconcerned look, the most free and undaunted composure, and hailed
      him with &ldquo;You, Sir Holly-top, I would speak with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steady coolness and assurance with which these words were uttered,
      although the voice was the very voice he had heard at the old convent, and
      although the features more nearly resembled those of Catharine when seen
      close than when viewed from a distance, produced, nevertheless, such a
      confusion in Roland's mind, that he became uncertain whether he was not
      still under a mistake from the beginning; the knowing shrewdness which
      should have animated his visage faded into a sheepish bashfulness, and the
      half-suppressed but most intelligible smile, became the senseless giggle
      of one who laughs to cover his own disorder of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they understand a Scotch tongue in thy country, Holly-top?&rdquo; said this
      marvellous specimen of metamorphosis. &ldquo;I said I would speak with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business with my comrade, my young chick of the game?&rdquo; said
      Adam Woodcock, willing to step in to his companion's assistance, though
      totally at a loss to account for the sudden disappearance of all Roland's
      usual smartness and presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to you, my old cock of the perch,&rdquo; replied the gallant; &ldquo;go mind
      your hawk's castings. I guess by your bag and your gauntlet that you are
      squire of the body to a sort of kites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he spoke, and the laugh reminded Roland so irresistibly of
      the hearty fit of risibility, in which Catherine had indulged at his
      expense when they first met in the old nunnery, that he could scarce help
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Catherine Seyton, by Heavens!&rdquo;&mdash;He checked the
      exclamation, however, and only said, &ldquo;I think, sir, we two are not totally
      strangers to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have met in our dreams then&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;and my days are too
      busy to remember what I think on at nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or apparently to remember upon one day those whom you may have seen on
      the preceding eve&rdquo; said Roland Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth in his turn cast on him a look of some surprise, as he replied,
      &ldquo;I know no more of what you mean than does the horse I ride on&mdash;if
      there be offence in your words, you shall find me ready to take it as any
      lad in Lothian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;though it pleases you to use the language
      of a stranger, that with you I have no purpose to quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do mine errand, then, and be rid of you,&rdquo; said the page. &ldquo;Step
      hither this way, out of that old leathern fist's hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked into the recess of the window, which Roland had left upon the
      youth's entrance into the apartment. The messenger then turned his back on
      the company, after casting a hasty and sharp glance around to see if they
      were observed. Roland did the same, and the page in the purple mantle thus
      addressed him, taking at the same time from under his cloak a short but
      beautifully wrought sword, with the hilt and ornaments upon the sheath of
      silver, massively chased and over-gilded&mdash;&ldquo;I bring you this weapon
      from a friend, who gives it you under the solemn condition, that you will
      not unsheath it until you are commanded by your rightful Sovereign. For
      your warmth of temper is known, and the presumption with which you intrude
      yourself into the quarrels of others; and, therefore, this is laid upon
      you as a penance by those who wish you well, and whose hand will influence
      your destiny for good or for evil. This is what I was charged to tell you.
      So if you will give a fair word for a fair sword, and pledge your promise,
      with hand and glove, good and well; and if not, I will carry back Caliburn
      to those who sent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I not ask who these are?&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, admiring at the
      same time the beauty of the weapon thus offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My commission in no way leads me to answer such a question,&rdquo; said he of
      the purple mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I am offended&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;may I not draw to defend myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>this</i> weapon,&rdquo; answered the sword-bearer; &ldquo;but you have your
      own at command, and, besides, for what do you wear your poniard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For no good,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, who had now approached close to them,
      &ldquo;and that I can witness as well as any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back, fellow,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;thou hast an intrusive curious
      face, that will come by a buffet if it is found where it has no concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A buffet, my young Master Malapert?&rdquo; said Adam, drawing back, however;
      &ldquo;best keep down fist, or, by Our Lady, buffet will beget buffet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient, Adam Woodcock,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;and let me pray you,
      fair sir, since by such addition you choose for the present to be
      addressed, may I not barely unsheathe this fair weapon, in pure simplicity
      of desire to know whether so fair a hilt and scabbard are matched with a
      befitting blade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no manner of means,&rdquo; said the messenger; &ldquo;at a word, you must take it
      under the promise that you never draw it until you receive the commands of
      your lawful Sovereign, or you must leave it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under that condition, and coming from your friendly hand, I accept of the
      sword,&rdquo; said Roland, taking it from his hand; &ldquo;but credit me, if we are to
      work together in any weighty emprise, as I am induced to believe, some
      confidence and openness on your part will be necessary to give the right
      impulse to my zeal&mdash;I press for no more at present, it is enough that
      you understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you!&rdquo; said the page, exhibiting the appearance of unfeigned
      surprise in his turn,&mdash;&ldquo;Renounce me if I do!&mdash;here you stand
      jiggeting, and sniggling, and looking cunning, as if there were some
      mighty matter of intrigue and common understanding betwixt you and me,
      whom you never set your eyes on before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;will you deny that we have met before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry that I will, in any Christian court,&rdquo; said the other page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you also deny,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;that it was recommended to us to
      study each other's features well, that in whatever disguise the time might
      impose upon us, each should recognize in the other the secret agent of a
      mighty work? Do not you remember, that Sister Magdalen and Dame Bridget&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger here interrupted him, shrugging up his shoulders, with a
      look of compassion, &ldquo;Bridget and Magdalen! why, this is madness and
      dreaming! Hark ye, Master Holly-top, your wits are gone on wool-gathering;
      comfort yourself with a caudle, and thatch your brain-sick noddle with a
      woollen night-cap, and so God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded this polite parting address, Adam Woodcock, who was again
      seated by the table on which stood the now empty can, said to him, &ldquo;Will
      you drink a cup, young man, in the way of courtesy, now you have done your
      errand, and listen to a good song?&rdquo; and without waiting for an answer, he
      commenced his ditty,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Pope, that pagan full of pride,
  Hath blinded us full lang&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is probable that the good wine had made some innovation in the
      falconer's brain, otherwise he would have recollected the danger of
      introducing any thing like political or polemical pleasantry into a public
      assemblage at a time when men's minds were in a state of great
      irritability. To do him justice, he perceived his error, and stopped short
      so soon as he saw that the word Pope had at once interrupted the separate
      conversations of the various parties which were assembled in the
      apartment; and that many began to draw themselves up, bridle, look big,
      and prepare to take part in the impending brawl; while others, more decent
      and cautious persons, hastily paid down their lawing, and prepared to
      leave the place ere bad should come to worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to worse it was soon likely to come; for no sooner did Woodcock's
      ditty reach the ear of the stranger page, than, uplifting his riding-rod,
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;He who speaks irreverently of the Holy Father of the church
      in my presence, is the cub of a heretic wolf-bitch, and I will switch him
      as I would a mongrel-cur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will break thy young pate,&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;if thou darest to lift a
      finger to me.&rdquo; And then, in defiance of the young Drawcansir's threats,
      with a stout heart and dauntless accent, he again uplifted the stave.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Pope, that pagan full of pride.
  Hath blinded&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But Adam was able to proceed no farther, being himself unfortunately
      blinded by a stroke of the impatient youth's switch across his eyes.
      Enraged at once by the smart and the indignity, the falconer started up,
      and darkling as he was, for his eyes watered too fast to permit his seeing
      any thing, he would soon have been at close grips with his insolent
      adversary, had not Roland Graeme, contrary to his nature, played for once
      the prudent man and the peacemaker, and thrown himself betwixt them,
      imploring Woodcock's patience. &ldquo;You know not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with whom you
      have to do.&mdash;And thou,&rdquo; addressing the messenger, who stood
      scornfully laughing at Adam's rage, &ldquo;get thee gone, whoever thou art; if
      thou be'st what I guess thee, thou well knowest there are earnest reasons
      why thou shouldst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast hit it right for once, Holly-top,&rdquo; said the gallant, &ldquo;though I
      guess you drew your bow at a venture.&mdash;Here, host, let this yeoman
      have a bottle of wine to wash the smart out of his eyes&mdash;and there is
      a French crown for him.&rdquo; So saying, he threw the piece of money on the
      table, and left the apartment, with a quick yet steady pace, looking
      firmly at right and left, as if to defy interruption: and snapping his
      fingers at two or three respectable burghers, who, declaring it was a
      shame that any one should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence of the
      Pope, were labouring to find the hilts of their swords, which had got for
      the present unhappily entangled in the folds of their cloaks. But, as the
      adversary was gone ere any of them had reached his weapon, they did not
      think it necessary to unsheath cold iron, but merely observed to each
      other, &ldquo;This is more than masterful violence, to see a poor man stricken
      in the face just for singing a ballad against the whore of Babylon! If the
      Pope's champions are to be bangsters in our very change-houses, we shall
      soon have the old shavelings back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The provost should look to it,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and have some five or six
      armed with partisans, to come in upon the first whistle, to teach these
      gallants their lesson. For, look you, neighbour Lugleather, it is not for
      decent householders like ourselves to be brawling with the godless grooms
      and pert pages of the nobles, that are bred up to little else save
      bloodshed and blasphemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that, neighbour,&rdquo; said Lugleather, &ldquo;I would have curried that
      youngster as properly as ever I curried a lamb's hide, had not the hilt of
      my bilbo been for the instant beyond my grasp; and before I could turn my
      girdle, gone was my master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the others, &ldquo;the devil go with him, and peace abide with us&mdash;I
      give my rede, neighbours, that we pay the lawing, and be stepping
      homeward, like brother and brother; for old Saint Giles's is tolling
      curfew, and the street grows dangerous at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the good burghers adjusted their cloaks, and prepared for their
      departure, while he that seemed the briskest of the three, laying his hand
      on his Andrea Ferrara, observed, &ldquo;that they that spoke in the praise of
      the Pope on the High-gate of Edinburgh, had best bring the sword of Saint
      Peter to defend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the ill-humour excited by the insolence of the young aristocrat was
      thus evaporating in empty menace, Roland Graeme had to control the far
      more serious indignation of Adam Woodcock. &ldquo;Why, man, it was but a switch
      across the mazzard&mdash;blow your nose, dry your eyes, and you will see
      all the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this light, which I cannot see,&rdquo; said Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;thou hast been a
      false friend to me, young man&mdash;neither taking up my rightful quarrel,
      nor letting me fight it out myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fy for shame, Adam Woodcock,&rdquo; replied the youth, determined to turn the
      tables on him, and become in turn the counsellor of good order and
      peaceable demeanour&mdash;&ldquo;I say, fy for shame!&mdash;Alas, that you will
      speak thus! Here are you sent with me, to prevent my innocent youth
      getting into snares&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish your innocent youth were cut short with a halter, with all my
      heart,&rdquo; said Adam, who began to see which way the admonition tended.
      &mdash;&ldquo;And instead of setting before me,&rdquo; continued Roland, &ldquo;an example
      of patience and sobriety becoming the falconer of Sir Halbert Glendinning,
      you quaff me off I know not how many flagons of ale, besides a gallon of
      wine, and a full measure of strong waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was but one small pottle,&rdquo; said poor Adam, whom consciousness of his
      own indiscretion now reduced to a merely defensive warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was enough to pottle you handsomely, however,&rdquo; said the page&mdash;&ldquo;And
      then, instead of going to bed to sleep off your liquor, must you sit
      singing your roistering songs about popes and pagans, till you have got
      your eyes almost switched out of your head; and but for my interference,
      whom your drunken ingratitude accuses of deserting you, yon galliard would
      have cut your throat, for he was whipping out a whinger as broad as my
      hand, and as sharp as a razor&mdash;And these are lessons for an
      inexperienced youth!&mdash;Oh, Adam! out upon you! out upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, amen, and with all my heart,&rdquo; said Adam; &ldquo;out upon my folly for
      expecting any thing but impertinent raillery from a page like thee, that
      if he saw his father in a scrape, would laugh at him, instead of lending
      him aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but I will lend you aid,&rdquo; said the page, still laughing, &ldquo;that is, I
      will lend thee aid to thy chamber, good Adam, where thou shalt sleep off
      wine and ale, ire and indignation, and awake the next morning with as much
      fair wit as nature has blessed thee withal. Only one thing I will warn
      thee, good Adam, that henceforth and for ever, when thou railest at me for
      being somewhat hot at hand, and rather too prompt to out with poniard or
      so, thy admonition shall serve as a prologue to the memorable adventure of
      the switching of Saint Michael's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such condoling expressions he got the crest-fallen falconer to his
      bed, and then retired to his own pallet, where it was some time ere he
      could fall asleep. If the messenger whom he had seen were really Catherine
      Seyton, what a masculine virago and termagant must she be! and stored with
      what an inimitable command of insolence and assurance!&mdash;The brass on
      her brow would furbish the front of twenty pages; &ldquo;and I should know,&rdquo;
       thought Roland, &ldquo;what that amounts to&mdash;And yet, her features, her
      look, her light gait, her laughing eye, the art with which she disposed
      the mantle to show no more of her limbs than needs must be seen&mdash;I am
      glad she had at least that grace left&mdash;the voice, the smile&mdash;it
      must have been Catherine Seyton, or the devil in her likeness! One thing
      is good, I have silenced the eternal predications of that ass, Adam
      Woodcock, who has set up for being a preacher and a governor, over me, so
      soon as he has left the hawks' mew behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this comfortable reflection, joined to the happy indifference
      which youth hath for the events of the morrow, Roland Graeme fell fast
      asleep.

    <h2>
      Chapter the Twentieth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now have you reft me from my staff, my guide,
  Who taught my youth, as men teach untamed falcons,
  To use my strength discreetly&mdash;I am reft
  Of comrade and of counsel.
                                        OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the gray of the next morning's dawn, there was a loud knocking at the
      gate of the hostelrie; and those without, proclaiming that they came in
      the name of the Regent, were instantly admitted. A moment or two
      afterwards, Michael Wing-the-wind stood by the bedside of our travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up! up!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no slumber where Murray hath work ado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both sleepers sprung up, and began to dress themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, old friend,&rdquo; said Wing-the-wind to Adam Woodcock, &ldquo;must to horse
      instantly, with this packet to the Monks of Kennaquhair; and with this,&rdquo;
       delivering them as he spoke, &ldquo;to the Knight of Avenel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as commanding the monks to annul their election, I'll warrant me,
      of an Abbot,&rdquo; quoth Adam Woodcock, as he put the packets into his bag,
      &ldquo;and charging my master to see it done&mdash;To hawk at one brother with
      another, is less than fair play, methinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fash not thy beard about it, old boy,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;but betake thee to
      the saddle presently; for if these orders are not obeyed, there will be
      bare walls at the Kirk of Saint Mary's, and it may be at the Castle of
      Avenel to boot; for I heard my Lord of Morton loud with the Regent, and we
      are at a pass that we cannot stand with him anent trifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Adam, &ldquo;touching the Abbot of Unreason&mdash;what say they to
      that outbreak&mdash;An they be shrewishly disposed, I were better pitch
      the packets to Satan, and take the other side of the Border for my bield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was passed over as a jest, since there was little harm done.&mdash;But,
      hark thee, Adam,&rdquo; continued his comrade, &ldquo;if there was a dozen vacant
      abbacies in your road, whether of jest or earnest, reason or unreason,
      draw thou never one of their mitres over thy brows.&mdash;The time is not
      fitting, man!&mdash;besides, our Maiden longs to clip the neck of a fat
      churchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall never sheer mine in that capacity,&rdquo; said the falconer, while he
      knotted the kerchief in two or three double folds around his sunburnt
      bull-neck, calling out at the same time, &ldquo;Master Roland, Master Roland,
      make haste! we must back to perch and mew, and, thank Heaven, more than
      our own wit, with our bones whole, and without a stab in the stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said Wing-the-wind, &ldquo;the page goes not back with you; the
      Regent has other employment for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints and sorrows!&rdquo; exclaimed the falconer&mdash;&ldquo;Master Roland Graeme
      to remain here, and I to return to Avenel!&mdash;Why, it cannot be&mdash;the
      child cannot manage himself in this wide world without me, and I question
      if he will stoop to any other whistle than mine own; there are times I
      myself can hardly bring him to my lure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at Roland's tongue's end to say something concerning the occasion
      they had for using mutually each other's prudence, but the real anxiety
      which Adam evinced at parting with him, took away his disposition to such
      ungracious raillery. The falconer did not altogether escape, however, for,
      in turning his face towards the lattice, his friend Michael caught a
      glimpse of it, and exclaimed, &ldquo;I prithee, Adam Woodcock, what hast thou
      been doing with these eyes of thine? They are swelled to the starting from
      the socket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nought in the world,&rdquo; said he, after casting a deprecating glance at
      Roland Graeme, &ldquo;but the effect of sleeping in this d&mdash;ned truckle
      without a pillow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Adam Woodcock, thou must be grown strangely dainty,&rdquo; said his old
      companion; &ldquo;I have known thee sleep all night with no better pillow than a
      bush of ling, and start up with the sun, as glegg as a falcon; and now
      thine eyes resemble&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man, what signifies how mine eyes look now?&rdquo; said Adam&mdash;&ldquo;let
      us but roast a crab-apple, pour a pottle of ale on it, and bathe our
      throats withal, thou shalt see a change in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou wilt be in heart to sing thy jolly ballad about the Pope,&rdquo; said
      his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that I will,&rdquo; replied the falconer, &ldquo;that is, when we have left this
      quiet town five miles behind us, if you will take your hobby and ride so
      far on my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that I may not,&rdquo; said Michael&mdash;&ldquo;I can but stop to partake your
      morning draught, and see you fairly to horse&mdash;I will see that they
      saddle them, and toast the crab for thee, without loss of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During his absence the falconer took the page by the hand&mdash;&ldquo;May I
      never hood hawk again,&rdquo; said the good-natured fellow, &ldquo;if I am not as
      sorry to part with you as if you were a child of mine own, craving pardon
      for the freedom&mdash;I cannot tell what makes me love you so much, unless
      it be for the reason that I loved the vicious devil of a brown galloway
      nag whom my master the Knight called Satan, till Master Warden changed his
      name to Seyton; for he said it was over boldness to call a beast after the
      King of Darkness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;it was over boldness in him, I trow, to call a
      vicious brute after a noble family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; proceeded Adam, &ldquo;Seyton or Satan, I loved that nag over every
      other horse in the stable&mdash;-There was no sleeping on his back&mdash;he
      was for ever fidgeting, bolting, rearing, biting, kicking, and giving you
      work to do, and maybe the measure of your back on the heather to the boot
      of it all. And I think I love you better than any lad in the castle, for
      the self-same qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, thanks, kind Adam. I regard myself bound to you for the good
      estimation in which you hold me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, interrupt me not,&rdquo; said the falconer&mdash;&ldquo;Satan was a good nag&mdash;But
      I say I think I shall call the two eyases after you, the one Roland, and
      the other Graeme; and while Adam Woodcock lives, be sure you have a friend&mdash;Here
      is to thee, my dear son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland most heartily returned the grasp of the hand, and Woodcock, having
      taken a deep draught, continued his farewell speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three things I warn you against, Roland, now that you art to
      tread this weary world without my experience to assist you. In the first
      place, never draw dagger on slight occasion&mdash;every man's doublet is
      not so well stuffed as a certain abbot's that you wot of. Secondly, fly
      not at every pretty girl, like a merlin at a thrush&mdash;you will not
      always win a gold chain for your labour&mdash;and, by the way, here I
      return to you your fanfarona&mdash;keep it close, it is weighty, and may
      benefit you at a pinch more ways than one. Thirdly, and to conclude, as
      our worthy preacher says, beware of the pottle-pot&mdash;it has drenched
      the judgment of wiser men than you. I could bring some instances of it,
      but I dare say it needeth not; for if you should forget your own mishaps,
      you will scarce fail to remember mine&mdash;And so farewell, my dear son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland returned his good wishes, and failed not to send his humble duty to
      his kind Lady, charging the falconer, at the same time, to express his
      regret that he should have offended her, and his determination so to bear
      him in the world that she would not be ashamed of the generous protection
      she had afforded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer embraced his young friend, mounted his stout, round-made,
      trotting-nag, which the serving-man, who had attended him, held ready at
      the door, and took the road to the southward. A sullen and heavy sound
      echoed from the horse's feet, as if indicating the sorrow of the
      good-natured rider. Every hoof-tread seemed to tap upon Roland's heart as
      he heard his comrade withdraw with so little of his usual alert activity,
      and felt that he was once more alone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused from his reverie by Michael Wing-the-wind, who reminded him
      that it was necessary they should instantly return to the palace, as my
      Lord Regent went to the Sessions early in the morning. They went thither
      accordingly, and Wing-the-wind, a favourite old domestic, who was admitted
      nearer to the Regent's person and privacy, than many whose posts were more
      ostensible, soon introduced Graeme into a small matted chamber, where he
      had an audience of the present head of the troubled State of Scotland. The
      Earl of Murray was clad in a sad-coloured morning-gown, with a cap and
      slippers of the same cloth, but, even in this easy deshabillé, held his
      sheathed rapier in his hand, a precaution which he adopted when receiving
      strangers, rather in compliance with the earnest remonstrances of his
      friends and partisans, than from any personal apprehensions of his own. He
      answered with a silent nod the respectful obeisance of the page, and took
      one or two turns through the small apartment in silence, fixing his keen
      eye on Roland, as if he wished to penetrate into his very soul. At length
      he broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is, I think, Julian Graeme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roland Graeme, my lord, not Julian,&rdquo; replied the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;I was misled by some trick of my memory&mdash;Roland Graeme,
      from the Debateable Land.&mdash;Roland, thou knowest the duties which
      belong to a lady's service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should know them, my lord,&rdquo; replied Roland, &ldquo;having been bred so near
      the person of my Lady of Avenel; but I trust never more to practise them,
      as the Knight hath promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, young man,&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;I am to speak, and you to hear
      and obey. It is necessary that, for some space at least, you shall again
      enter into the service of a lady, who, in rank, hath no equal in Scotland;
      and this service accomplished, I give thee my word as Knight and Prince,
      that it shall open to you a course of ambition, such as may well gratify
      the aspiring wishes of one whom circumstances entitle to entertain much
      higher views than thou. I will take thee into my household and near to my
      person, or, at your own choice, I will give you the command of a
      foot-company&mdash;either is a preferment which the proudest laird in the
      land might be glad to ensure for a second son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I presume to ask, my lord,&rdquo; said Roland, observing the Earl paused
      for a reply, &ldquo;to whom my poor services are in the first place destined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be told hereafter,&rdquo; said the Regent; and then, as if overcoming
      some internal reluctance to speak farther himself, he added, &ldquo;or why
      should I not myself tell you, that you are about to enter into the service
      of a most illustrious&mdash;most unhappy lady&mdash;into the service of
      Mary of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Queen, my lord!&rdquo; said the page, unable to suppress his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of her who was the Queen!&rdquo; said Murray, with a singular mixture of
      displeasure and embarrassment in his tone of voice. &ldquo;You must be aware,
      young man, that her son reigns in her stead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed from an emotion, partly natural, perhaps, and partly assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I to attend upon her Grace in her place of imprisonment, my lord?&rdquo;
       again demanded the page, with a straightforward and hardy simplicity,
      which somewhat disconcerted the sage and powerful statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not imprisoned,&rdquo; answered Murray, angrily; &ldquo;God forbid she should&mdash;she
      is only sequestered from state affairs, and from the business of the
      public, until the world be so effectually settled, that she may enjoy her
      natural and uncontrolled freedom, without her royal disposition being
      exposed to the practices of wicked and designing men. It is for this
      purpose,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that while she is to be furnished, as right is, with
      such attendance as may befit her present secluded state, it becomes
      necessary that those placed around her, are persons on whose prudence I
      can have reliance. You see, therefore, you are at once called on to
      discharge an office most honourable in itself, and so to discharge it that
      you may make a friend of the Regent of Scotland. Thou art, I have been
      told, a singularly apprehensive youth; and I perceive by thy look, that
      thou dost already understand what I would say on this matter. In this
      schedule your particular points of duty are set down at length&mdash;but
      the sum required of you is fidelity&mdash;I mean fidelity to myself and to
      the state. You are, therefore, to watch every attempt which is made, or
      inclination displayed, to open any communication with any of the lords who
      have become banders in the west&mdash;with Hamilton, Seyton, with Fleming,
      or the like. It is true that my gracious sister, reflecting upon the ill
      chances that have happened to the state of this poor kingdom, from evil
      counsellors who have abused her royal nature in time past, hath determined
      to sequestrate herself from state affairs in future. But it is our duty,
      as acting for and in the name of our infant nephew, to guard against the
      evils which may arise from any mutation or vacillation in her royal
      resolutions. Wherefore, it will be thy duty to watch, and report to our
      lady mother, whose guest our sister is for the present, whatever may infer
      a disposition to withdraw her person from the place of security in which
      she is lodged, or to open communication with those without. If, however,
      your observation should detect any thing of weight, and which may exceed
      mere suspicion, fail not to send notice by an especial messenger to me
      directly, and this ring shall be thy warrant to order horse and men on
      such service.&mdash;And now begone. If there be half the wit in thy head
      that there is apprehension in thy look, thou fully comprehendest all that
      I would say&mdash;Serve me faithfully, and sure as I am belted earl, thy
      reward shall be great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme made an obeisance, and was about to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl signed to him to remain. &ldquo;I have trusted thee deeply,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;young man, for thou art the only one of her suite who has been sent to
      her by my own recommendation. Her gentlewomen are of her own nomination&mdash;it
      were too hard to have barred her that privilege, though some there were
      who reckoned it inconsistent with sure policy. Thou art young and
      handsome. Mingle in their follies, and see they cover not deeper designs
      under the appearance of female levity&mdash;if they do mine, do thou
      countermine. For the rest, bear all decorum and respect to the person of
      thy mistress&mdash;she is a princess, though a most unhappy one, and hath
      been a queen! though now, alas! no longer such! Pay, therefore, to her all
      honour and respect, consistent with thy fidelity to the King and me&mdash;and
      now, farewell.&mdash;Yet stay&mdash;you travel with Lord Lindesay, a man
      of the old world, rough and honest, though untaught; see that thou offend
      him not, for he is not patient of raillery, and thou, I have heard, art a
      crack-halter.&rdquo; This he said with a smile, then added, &ldquo;I could have wished
      the Lord Lindesay's mission had been intrusted to some other and more
      gentle noble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore should you wish that, my lord?&rdquo; said Morton, who even then
      entered the apartment; &ldquo;the council have decided for the best&mdash;we
      have had but too many proofs of this lady's stubbornness of mind, and the
      oak that resists the sharp steel axe, must be riven with the rugged iron
      wedge.&mdash;And this is to be her page?&mdash;My Lord Regent hath
      doubtless instructed you, young man, how you shall guide yourself in these
      matters; I will add but a little hint on my part. You are going to the
      castle of a Douglas, where treachery never thrives&mdash;the first moment
      of suspicion will be the last of your life. My kinsman, William Douglas,
      understands no raillery, and if he once have cause to think you false, you
      will waver in the wind from the castle battlements ere the sun set upon
      his anger.&mdash;And is the lady to have an almoner withal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally, Douglas,&rdquo; said the Regent; &ldquo;it were hard to deny the
      spiritual consolation which she thinks essential to her salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ever too soft hearted, my lord&mdash;What! a false priest to
      communicate her lamentations, not only to our unfriends in Scotland, but
      to the Guises, to Rome, to Spain, and I know not where!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;we will take such order that no treachery
      shall happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to it then.&rdquo; said Morton; &ldquo;you know my mind respecting the wench you
      have consented she shall receive as a waiting-woman&mdash;one of a family,
      which, of all others, has ever been devoted to her, and inimical to us.
      Had we not been wary, she would have been purveyed of a page as much to
      her purpose as her waiting-damsel. I hear a rumour that an old mad Romish
      pilgrimer, who passes for at least half a saint among them, was employed
      to find a fit subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have escaped that danger at least,&rdquo; said Murray, &ldquo;and converted it
      into a point of advantage, by sending this boy of Glendinning's&mdash;and
      for her waiting-damsel, you cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead of
      her four noble Marys and all their silken train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not so much for the waiting-maiden,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;but I cannot
      brook the almoner&mdash;I think priests of all persuasions are much like
      each other&mdash;Here is John Knox, who made such a noble puller-down, is
      ambitious of becoming a setter-up, and a founder of schools and colleges
      out of the Abbey lands, and bishops' rents, and other spoils of Rome,
      which the nobility of Scotland have won with their sword and bow, and with
      which he would endow new hives to sing the old drone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John is a man of God,&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;and his scheme is a devout
      imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sedate smile with which this was spoken, left it impossible to
      conjecture whether the words were meant in approbation, or in derision, of
      the plan of the Scottish Reformer. Turning then to Roland Graeme, as if he
      thought he had been long enough a witness of this conversation, he bade
      him get him presently to horse, since my Lord of Lindesay was already
      mounted. The page made his reverence, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by Michael Wing-the-wind, he found his horse ready saddled and
      prepared for the journey, in front of the palace porch, where hovered
      about a score of men-at-arms, whose leader showed no small symptoms of
      surly impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the jackanape page for whom we have waited thus long?&rdquo; said he to
      Wing-the-wind.&mdash;&ldquo;And my Lord Ruthven will reach the castle long
      before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael assented, and added, that the boy had been detained by the Regent
      to receive some parting instructions. The leader made an inarticulate
      sound in his throat, expressive of sullen acquiescence, and calling to one
      of his domestic attendants, &ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take the gallant into your
      charge, and let him speak with no one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then addressed, by the title of Sir Robert, an elderly and
      respectable-looking gentleman, the only one of the party who seemed above
      the rank of a retainer or domestic, and observed, that they must get to
      horse with all speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse, and while they were riding slowly along the street
      of the suburb, Roland had time to examine more accurately the looks and
      figure of the Baron, who was at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lindesay of the Byres was rather touched than stricken with years.
      His upright stature and strong limbs, still showed him fully equal to all
      the exertions and fatigues of war. His thick eyebrows, now partially
      grizzled, lowered over large eyes full of dark fire, which seemed yet
      darker from the uncommon depth at which they were set in his head. His
      features, naturally strong and harsh, had their sternness exaggerated by
      one or two scars received in battle. These features, naturally calculated
      to express the harsher passions, were shaded by an open steel cap, with a
      projecting front, but having no visor, over the gorget of which fell the
      black and grizzled beard of the grim old Baron, and totally hid the lower
      part of his face. The rest of his dress was a loose buff-coat, which had
      once been lined with silk and adorned with embroidery, but which seemed
      much stained with travel, and damaged with cuts, received probably in
      battle. It covered a corslet, which had once been of polished steel,
      fairly gilded, but was now somewhat injured with rust. A sword of antique
      make and uncommon size, framed to be wielded with both hands, a kind of
      weapon which was then beginning to go out of use, hung from his neck in a
      baldrick, and was so disposed as to traverse his whole person, the huge
      hilt appearing over his left shoulder, and the point reaching well-nigh to
      the right heel, and jarring against his spur as he walked. This unwieldy
      weapon could only be unsheathed by pulling the handle over the left
      shoulder&mdash;for no human arm was long enough to draw it in the usual
      manner. The whole equipment was that of a rude warrior, negligent of his
      exterior even to misanthropical sullenness; and the short, harsh, haughty
      tone, which he used towards his attendants, belonged to the same
      unpolished character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personage who rode with Lord Lindesay, at the head of the party, was
      an absolute contrast to him, in manner, form, and features. His thin and
      silky hair was already white, though he seemed not above forty-five or
      fifty years old. His tone of voice was soft and insinuating&mdash;his form
      thin, spare, and bent by an habitual stoop&mdash;his pale cheek was
      expressive of shrewdness and intelligence&mdash;his eye was quick though
      placid, and his whole demeanour mild and conciliatory. He rode an ambling
      nag, such as were used by ladies, clergymen, or others of peaceful
      professions&mdash;wore a riding habit of black velvet, with a cap and
      feather of the same hue, fastened up by a golden medal&mdash;and for show,
      and as a mark of rank rather than for use, carried a walking-sword, (as
      the short light rapiers were called,) without any other arms, offensive or
      defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party had now quitted the town, and proceeded, at a steady trot,
      towards the west.&mdash;As they prosecuted their journey, Roland Graeme
      would gladly have learned something of its purpose and tendency, but the
      countenance of the personage next to whom he had been placed in the train,
      discouraged all approach to familiarity. The Baron himself did not look
      more grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer, whose grisly beard
      fell over his mouth like the portcullis before the gate of a castle, as if
      for the purpose of preventing the escape of any word, of which absolute
      necessity did not demand the utterance. The rest of the train seemed under
      the same taciturn influence, and journeyed on without a word being
      exchanged amongst them&mdash;more like a troop of Carthusian friars than a
      party of military retainers. Roland Graeme was surprised at this extremity
      of discipline; for even in the household of the Knight of Avenel, though
      somewhat distinguished for the accuracy with which decorum was enforced, a
      journey was a period of license, during which jest and song, and every
      thing within the limits of becoming mirth and pastime were freely
      permitted. This unusual silence was, however, so far acceptable, that it
      gave him time to bring any shadow of judgment which he possessed to
      council on his own situation and prospects, which would have appeared to
      any reasonable person in the highest degree dangerous and perplexing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident that he had, through various circumstances not under
      his own control, formed contradictory connexions with both the contending
      factions, by whose strife the kingdom was distracted, without being
      properly an adherent of either. It seemed also clear, that the same
      situation in the household of the deposed Queen, to which he was now
      promoted by the influence of the Regent, had been destined to him by his
      enthusiastic grandmother, Magdalen Graeme; for on this subject, the words
      which Morton had dropped had been a ray of light; yet it was no less clear
      that these two persons, the one the declared enemy, the other the
      enthusiastic votary, of the Catholic religion,&mdash;the one at the head
      of the King's new government, the other, who regarded that government as a
      criminal usurpation&mdash;must have required and expected very different
      services from the individual whom they had thus united in recommending. It
      required very little reflection to foresee that these contradictory claims
      on his services might speedily place him in a situation where his honour
      as well as his life might be endangered. But it was not in Roland Graeme's
      nature to anticipate evil before it came, or to prepare to combat
      difficulties before they arrived. &ldquo;I will see this beautiful and
      unfortunate Mary Stewart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of whom we have heard so much, and
      then there will be time enough to determine whether I will be kingsman or
      queensman. None of them can say I have given word or promise to either of
      their factions; for they have led me up and down like a blind Billy,
      without giving me any light into what I was to do. But it was lucky that
      grim Douglas came into the Regent's closet this morning, otherwise I had
      never got free of him without plighting my troth to do all the Earl would
      have me, which seemed, after all, but foul play to the poor imprisoned
      lady, to place her page as an espial on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Skipping thus lightly over a matter of such consequence, the thoughts of
      the hare-brained boy went a wool-gathering after more agreeable topics.
      Now he admired the Gothic towers of Barnbougle, rising from the seabeaten
      rock, and overlooking one of the most glorious landscapes in Scotland&mdash;and
      now he began to consider what notable sport for the hounds and the hawks
      must be afforded by the variegated ground over which they travelled&mdash;and
      now he compared the steady and dull trot at which they were then
      prosecuting their journey, with the delight of sweeping over hill and dale
      in pursuit of his favourite sports. As, under the influence of these
      joyous recollections, he gave his horse the spur, and made him execute a
      gambade, he instantly incurred the censure of his grave neighbour, who
      hinted to him to keep the pace, and move quietly and in order, unless he
      wished such notice to be taken of his eccentric movements as was likely to
      be very displeasing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebuke and the restraint under which the youth now found himself,
      brought back to his recollection his late good-humoured and accommodating
      associate and guide, Adam Woodcock; and from that topic his imagination
      made a short flight to Avenel Castle, to the quiet and unconfined life of
      its inhabitants, the goodness of his early protectress, not forgetting the
      denizens of its stables, kennels, and hawk-mews. In a brief space, all
      these subjects of meditation gave way to the resemblance of that riddle of
      womankind, Catherine Seyton, who appeared before the eye of his mind&mdash;now
      in her female form, now in her male attire&mdash;now in both at once&mdash;like
      some strange dream, which presents to us the same individual under two
      different characters at the same instant. Her mysterious present also
      recurred to his recollection&mdash;the sword which he now wore at his
      side, and which he was not to draw save by command of his legitimate
      Sovereign! But the key of this mystery he judged he was likely to find in
      the issue of his present journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such thoughts passing through his mind, Roland Graeme accompanied the
      party of Lord Lindesay to the Queen's-Ferry, which they passed in vessels
      that lay in readiness for them. They encountered no adventure whatever in
      their passage, excepting one horse being lamed in getting into the boat,
      an accident very common on such occasions, until a few years ago, when the
      ferry was completely regulated. What was more peculiarly characteristic of
      the olden age, was the discharge of a culverin at the party from the
      battlements of the old castle of Rosythe, on the north side of the Ferry,
      the lord of which happened to have some public or private quarrel with the
      Lord Lindesay, and took this mode of expressing his resentment. The
      insult, however, as it was harmless, remained unnoticed and unavenged, nor
      did any thing else occur worth notice until the band had come where
      Lochleven spread its magnificent sheet of waters to the beams of a bright
      summer's sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient castle, which occupies an island nearly in the centre of the
      lake, recalled to the page that of Avenel, in which he had been nurtured.
      But the lake was much larger, and adorned with several islets besides that
      on which the fortress was situated; and instead of being embosomed in
      hills like that of Avenel, had upon the southern side only a splendid
      mountainous screen, being the descent of one of the Lomond hills, and on
      the other was surrounded by the extensive and fertile plain of Kinross.
      Roland Graeme looked with some degree of dismay on the water-girdled
      fortress, which then, as now, consisted only of one large donjon-keep,
      surrounded with a court-yard, with two round flanking-towers at the
      angles, which contained within its circuit some other buildings of
      inferior importance. A few old trees, clustered together near the castle,
      gave some relief to the air of desolate seclusion; but yet the page, while
      he gazed upon a building so sequestrated, could not but feel for the
      situation of a captive Princess doomed to dwell there, as well as for his
      own. &ldquo;I must have been born,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;under the star that presides
      over ladies and lakes of water, for I cannot by any means escape from the
      service of the one, or from dwelling in the other. But if they allow me
      not the fair freedom of my sport and exercise, they shall find it as hard
      to confine a wild-drake, as a youth who can swim like one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The band had now reached the edge of the water, and one of the party
      advancing displayed Lord Lindesay's pennon, waving it repeatedly to and
      fro, while that Baron himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle. A
      banner was presently displayed from the roof of the castle in reply to
      these signals, and one or two figures were seen busied as if unmooring a
      boat which lay close to the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be some time ere they can reach us with the boat,&rdquo; said the
      companion of Lord Lindesay; &ldquo;should we not do well to proceed to the town,
      and array ourselves in some better order, ere we appear before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do as you list, Sir Robert,&rdquo; replied Lindesay, &ldquo;I have neither
      time nor temper to waste on such vanities. She has cost me many a hard
      ride, and must not now take offence at the threadbare cloak and soiled
      doublet that I am arrayed in. It is the livery to which she has brought
      all Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak so harshly,&rdquo; said Sir Robert; &ldquo;if she hath done wrong, she
      hath dearly abied it; and in losing all real power, one would not deprive
      her of the little external homage due at once to a lady and a princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say to you once more, Sir Robert Melville,&rdquo; replied Lindesay, &ldquo;do as
      you will&mdash;for me, I am now too old to dink myself as a gallant to
      grace the bower of dames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bower of dames, my lord!&rdquo; said Melville, looking at the rude old
      tower&mdash;&ldquo;is it yon dark and grated castle, the prison of a captive
      Queen, to which you give so gay a name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it as you list,&rdquo; replied Lindesay; &ldquo;had the Regent desired to send
      an envoy capable to speak to a captive Queen, there are many gallants in
      his court who would have courted the occasion to make speeches out of
      Amadis of Gaul, or the Mirror of Knighthood. But when he sent blunt old
      Lindesay, he knew he would speak to a misguided woman, as her former
      misdoings and her present state render necessary. I sought not this
      employment&mdash;it has been thrust upon me; and I will not cumber myself
      with more form in the discharge of it, than needs must be tacked to such
      an occupation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Lord Lindesay threw himself from horseback, and wrapping his
      riding-cloak around him, lay down at lazy length upon the sward, to await
      the arrival of the boat, which was now seen rowing from the castle towards
      the shore. Sir Robert Melville, who had also dismounted, walked at short
      turns to and fro upon the bank, his arms crossed on his breast, often
      looking to the castle, and displaying in his countenance a mixture of
      sorrow and of anxiety. The rest of the party sate like statues on
      horseback, without moving so much as the points of their lances, which
      they held upright in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the boat approached a rude quay or landing-place, near to which
      they had stationed themselves, Lord Lindesay started up from his recumbent
      posture, and asked the person who steered, why he had not brought a larger
      boat with him to transport his retinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please you,&rdquo; replied the boatman, &ldquo;because it is the order of our
      lady, that we bring not to the castle more than four persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy lady is a wise woman,&rdquo; said Lindesay, &ldquo;to suspect me of treachery!&mdash;Or,
      had I intended it, what was to hinder us from throwing you and your
      comrades into the lake, and filling the boat with my own fellows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steersman, on hearing this, made a hasty signal to his men to back
      their oars, and hold off from the shore which they were approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thou ass,&rdquo; said Lindesay, &ldquo;thou didst not think that I meant thy
      fool's head serious harm? Hark thee, friend&mdash;with fewer than three
      servants I will go no whither&mdash;Sir Robert Melville will require at
      least the attendance of one domestic; and it will be at your peril and
      your lady's to refuse us admission, come hither as we are, on matters of
      great national concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steersman answered with firmness, but with great civility of
      expression, that his orders were positive to bring no more than four into
      the island, but he offered to row back to obtain a revisal of his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, my friend,&rdquo; said Sir Robert Melville, after he had in vain
      endeavoured to persuade his stubborn companion to consent to a temporary
      abatement of his train, &ldquo;row back to the castle, sith it will be no
      better, and obtain thy lady's orders to transport the Lord Lindesay,
      myself, and our retinue hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hearken,&rdquo; said Lord Lindesay, &ldquo;take with you this page, who comes as
      an attendant on your lady's guest.&mdash;Dismount, sirrah,&rdquo; said he,
      addressing Roland, &ldquo;and embark with them in that boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to become of my horse?&rdquo; said Graeme; &ldquo;I am answerable for him
      to my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will relieve you of the charge,&rdquo; said Lindesay; &ldquo;thou wilt have little
      enough to do with horse, saddle, or bridle, for ten years to come&mdash;Thou
      mayst take the halter an thou wilt&mdash;it may stand thee in a turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought so,&rdquo; said Roland&mdash;but he was interrupted by Sir Robert
      Melville, who said to him good-humouredly, &ldquo;Dispute it not, young friend&mdash;resistance
      can do no good, but may well run thee into danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme felt the justice of what he said, and, though neither
      delighted with the matter or manner of Lindesay's address, deemed it best
      to submit to necessity, and to embark without farther remonstrance. The
      men plied their oars. The quay, with the party of horse stationed near it,
      receded from the page's eyes&mdash;the castle and the islet seemed to draw
      near in the same proportion, and in a brief space he landed under the
      shadow of a huge old tree which overhung the landing place. The steersman
      and Graeme leaped ashore; the boatmen remained lying on their oars ready
      for further service.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Could valour aught avail or people's love,
    France had not wept Navarre's brave Henry slain;
  If wit or beauty could compassion move,
    The rose of Scotland had not wept in vain.
           <i>Elegy in a Royal Mausoleum.</i> LEWIS.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the gate of the court-yard of Lochleven appeared the stately form of
      the Lady Lochleven, a female whose early charms had captivated James V.,
      by whom she became mother of the celebrated Regent Murray. As she was of
      noble birth (being a daughter of the house of Mar) and of great beauty,
      her intimacy with James did not prevent her being afterwards sought in
      honourable marriage by many gallants of the time, among whom she had
      preferred Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. But well has it been said
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Our pleasant vices
  Are made the whips to scourge us&rdquo;&mdash;-
</pre>
    <p>
      The station which the Lady of Lochleven now held as the wife of a man of
      high rank and interest, and the mother of a lawful family, did not prevent
      her nourishing a painful sense of degradation, even while she was proud of
      the talents, the power, and the station of her son, now prime ruler of the
      state, but still a pledge of her illicit intercourse. &ldquo;Had James done to
      her,&rdquo; she said, in her secret heart, &ldquo;the justice he owed her, she had
      seen in her son, as a source of unmixed delight and of unchastened pride,
      the lawful monarch of Scotland, and one of the ablest who ever swayed the
      sceptre.&rdquo; The House of Mar, not inferior in antiquity or grandeur to that
      of Drummond, would then have also boasted a Queen among its daughters, and
      escaped the stain attached to female frailty, even when it has a royal
      lover for its apology. While such feelings preyed on a bosom naturally
      proud and severe, they had a corresponding effect on her countenance,
      where, with the remains of great beauty, were mingled traits of inward
      discontent and peevish melancholy. It perhaps contributed to increase this
      habitual temperament, that the Lady Lochleven had adopted uncommonly rigid
      and severe views of religion, imitating in her ideas of reformed faith the
      very worst errors of the Catholics, in limiting the benefit of the gospel
      to those who profess their own speculative tenets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every respect, the unfortunate Queen Mary, now the compulsory guest, or
      rather prisoner, of this sullen lady, was obnoxious to her hostess. Lady
      Lochleven disliked her as the daughter of Mary of Guise, the legal
      possessor of those rights over James's heart and hand, of which she
      conceived herself to have been injuriously deprived; and yet more so as
      the professor of a religion which she detested worse than Paganism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the dame, who, with stately mien, and sharp yet handsome
      features, shrouded by her black velvet coif, interrogated the domestic who
      steered her barge to the shore, what had become of Lindesay and Sir Robert
      Melville. The man related what had passed, and she smiled scornfully as
      she replied, &ldquo;Fools must be flattered, not foughten with.&mdash;Row back&mdash;make
      thy excuse as thou canst&mdash;say Lord Ruthven hath already reached this
      castle, and that he is impatient for Lord Lindesay's presence. Away with
      thee, Randal&mdash;yet stay&mdash;what galopin is that thou hast brought
      hither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please you, my lady, he is the page who is to wait upon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the new male minion,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven; &ldquo;the female attendant
      arrived yesterday. I shall have a well-ordered house with this lady and
      her retinue; but I trust they will soon find some others to undertake such
      a charge. Begone, Randal&mdash;and you&rdquo; (to Roland Graeme) &ldquo;follow me to
      the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way with a slow and stately step to the small garden, which,
      enclosed by a stone wall ornamented with statues, and an artificial
      fountain in the centre, extended its dull parterres on the side of the
      court-yard, with which it communicated by a low and arched portal. Within
      the narrow circuit of its formal and limited walks, Mary Stewart was now
      learning to perform the weary part of a prisoner, which, with little
      interval, she was doomed to sustain during the remainder of her life. She
      was followed in her slow and melancholy exercise by two female attendants;
      but in the first glance which Roland Graeme bestowed upon one so
      illustrious by birth, so distinguished by her beauty, accomplishments, and
      misfortunes, he was sensible of the presence of no other than the unhappy
      Queen of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face, her form, have been so deeply impressed upon the imagination,
      that even at the distance of nearly three centuries, it is unnecessary to
      remind the most ignorant and uninformed reader of the striking traits
      which characterize that remarkable countenance, which seems at once to
      combine our ideas of the majestic, the pleasing, and the brilliant,
      leaving us to doubt whether they express most happily the queen, the
      beauty, or the accomplished woman. Who is there, that, at the very mention
      of Mary Stewart's name, has not her countenance before him, familiar as
      that of the mistress of his youth, or the favourite daughter of his
      advanced age? Even those who feel themselves compelled to believe all, or
      much, of what her enemies laid to her charge, cannot think without a sigh
      upon a countenance expressive of anything rather than the foul crimes with
      which she was charged when living, and which still continue to shade, if
      not to blacken, her memory. That brow, so truly open and regal&mdash;those
      eyebrows, so regularly graceful, which yet were saved from the charge of
      regular insipidity by the beautiful effect of the hazel eyes which they
      overarched, and which seem to utter a thousand histories&mdash;the nose,
      with all its Grecian precision of outline&mdash;the mouth, so well
      proportioned, so sweetly formed, as if designed to speak nothing but what
      was delightful to hear&mdash;the dimpled chin&mdash;the stately swan-like
      neck, form a countenance, the like of which we know not to have existed in
      any other character moving in that class of life, where the actresses as
      well as the actors command general and undivided attention. It is in vain
      to say that the portraits which exist of this remarkable woman are not
      like each other; for, amidst their discrepancy, each possesses general
      features which the eye at once acknowledges as peculiar to the vision
      which our imagination has raised while we read her history for the first
      time, and which has been impressed upon it by the numerous prints and
      pictures which we have seen. Indeed we cannot look on the worst of them,
      however deficient in point of execution, without saying that it is meant
      for Queen Mary; and no small instance it is of the power of beauty, that
      her charms should have remained the subject not merely of admiration, but
      of warm and chivalrous interest, after the lapse of such a length of time.
      We know that by far the most acute of those who, in latter days, have
      adopted the unfavourable view of Mary's character, longed, like the
      executioner before his dreadful task was performed, to kiss the fair hand
      of her on whom he was about to perform so horrible a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dressed, then, in a deep mourning robe, and with all those charms of face,
      shape, and manner, with which faithful tradition has made each reader
      familiar, Mary Stewart advanced to meet the Lady of Lochleven, who, on her
      part, endeavoured to conceal dislike and apprehension under the appearance
      of respectful indifference. The truth was, that she had experienced
      repeatedly the Queen's superiority in that species of disguised yet
      cutting sarcasm, with which women can successfully avenge themselves, for
      real and substantial injuries. It may be well doubted, whether this talent
      was not as fatal to its possessor as the many others enjoyed by that
      highly gifted, but most unhappy female; for, while it often afforded her a
      momentary triumph over her keepers, it failed not to exasperate their
      resentment; and the satire and sarcasm in which she had indulged were
      frequently retaliated by the deep and bitter hardships which they had the
      power of inflicting. It is well known that her death was at length
      hastened by a letter which she wrote to Queen Elizabeth, in which she
      treated her jealous rival, and the Countess of Shrewsbury, with the
      keenest irony and ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ladies met together, the Queen said, bending her head at the same
      time, in return to the obeisance of the Lady Lochleven, &ldquo;We are this day
      fortunate&mdash;we enjoy the company of our amiable hostess at an unusual
      hour, and during a period which we have hitherto been permitted to give to
      our private exercise. But our good hostess knows well she has at all times
      access to our presence, and need not observe the useless ceremony of
      requiring our permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry my presence is deemed an intrusion by your Grace,&rdquo; said the
      Lady of Lochleven. &ldquo;I came but to announce the arrival of an addition to
      your train,&rdquo; motioning with her hand towards Roland Graeme; &ldquo;a
      circumstance to which ladies are seldom indifferent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I crave your ladyship's pardon; and am bent to the earth with
      obligations for the kindness of my nobles&mdash;or my sovereigns, shall I
      call them?&mdash;who have permitted me such a respectable addition to my
      personal retinue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have indeed studied, Madam,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;to show
      their kindness towards your Grace&mdash;something at the risk perhaps of
      sound policy, and I trust their doings will not be misconstrued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;the bounty which permits the daughter of so
      many kings, and who yet is Queen of the realm, the attendance of two
      waiting-women and a boy, is a grace which Mary Stewart can never
      sufficiently acknowledge. Why! my train will be equal to that of any
      country dame in this your kingdom of Fife, saving but the lack of a
      gentleman-usher, and a pair or two of blue-coated serving-men. But I must
      not forget, in my selfish joy, the additional trouble and charges to which
      this magnificent augmentation of our train will put our kind hostess, and
      the whole house of Lochleven. It is this prudent anxiety, I am aware,
      which clouds your brows, my worthy lady. But be of good cheer; the crown
      of Scotland has many a fair manor, and your affectionate son, and my no
      less affectionate brother, will endow the good knight your husband with
      the best of them, ere Mary should be dismissed from this hospitable castle
      from your ladyship's lack of means to support the charges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Douglasses of Lochleven, madam,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;have known for
      ages how to discharge their duty to the State, without looking for reward,
      even when the task was both irksome and dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! but, my dear Lochleven,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;you are over scrupulous&mdash;I
      pray you accept of a goodly manor; what should support the Queen of
      Scotland in this her princely court, saving her own crown-lands&mdash;and
      who should minister to the wants of a mother, save an affectionate son
      like the Earl of Murray, who possesses so wonderfully both the power and
      inclination?&mdash;Or said you it was the danger of the task which clouded
      your smooth and hospitable brow?&mdash;No doubt, a page is a formidable
      addition to my body-guard of females; and I bethink me it must have been
      for that reason that my Lord of Lindesay refused even now to venture
      within the reach of a force so formidable, without being attended by a
      competent retinue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Lochleven started, and looked something surprised; and Mary
      suddenly changing her manner from the smooth ironical affectation of
      mildness to an accent of austere command, and drawing up at the same time
      her fine person, said, with the full majesty of her rank, &ldquo;Yes! Lady of
      Lochleven; I know that Ruthven is already in the castle, and that Lindesay
      waits on the bank the return of your barge to bring him hither along with
      Sir Robert Melville. For what purpose do these nobles come&mdash;and why
      am I not in ordinary decency apprised of their arrival?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their purpose, madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;they must
      themselves explain&mdash;but a formal annunciation were needless, where
      your Grace hath attendants who can play the espial so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! poor Fleming,&rdquo; said the Queen, turning to the elder of the female
      attendants, &ldquo;thou wilt be tried, condemned, and gibbeted, for a spy in the
      garrison, because thou didst chance to cross the great hall while my good
      Lady of Lochleven was parleying at the full pitch of her voice with her
      pilot Randal. Put black wool in thy ears, girl, as you value the wearing
      of them longer. Remember, in the Castle of Lochleven, ears and tongues are
      matters not of use, but for show merely. Our good hostess can hear, as
      well as speak, for us all. We excuse your farther attendance, my lady
      hostess,&rdquo; she said, once more addressing the object of her resentment,
      &ldquo;and retire to prepare for an interview with our rebel lords. We will use
      the ante-chamber of our sleeping apartment as our hall of audience. You,
      young man,&rdquo; she proceeded, addressing Roland Graeme, and at once softening
      the ironical sharpness of her manner into good-humoured raillery, &ldquo;you,
      who are all our male attendance, from our Lord High Chamberlain down to
      our least galopin, follow us to prepare our court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and walked slowly towards the castle. The Lady of Lochleven
      folded her arms, and smiled in bitter resentment, as she watched her
      retiring steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole male attendance!&rdquo; she muttered, repeating the Queen's last
      words, &ldquo;and well for thee had it been had thy train never been larger;&rdquo;
       then turning to Roland, in whose way she had stood while making this
      pause, she made room for him to pass, saying at the same time, &ldquo;Art thou
      already eaves-dropping? follow thy mistress, minion, and, if thou wilt,
      tell her what I have now said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme hastened after his royal mistress and her attendants, who
      had just entered a postern-gate communicating betwixt the castle and the
      small garden. They ascended a winding-stair as high as the second story,
      which was in a great measure occupied by a suite of three rooms, opening
      into each other, and assigned as the dwelling of the captive Princess. The
      outermost was a small hall or ante-room, within which opened a large
      parlour, and from that again the Queen's bedroom. Another small apartment,
      which opened into the same parlour, contained the beds of the gentlewomen
      in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme stopped, as became his station, in the outermost of these
      apartments, there to await such orders as might be communicated to him.
      From the grated window of the room he saw Lindesay, Melville, and their
      followers disembark; and observed that they were met at the castle gate by
      a third noble, to whom Lindesay exclaimed, in his loud harsh voice, &ldquo;My
      Lord of Ruthven, you have the start of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the page's attention was called to a burst of hysterical
      sobs from the inner apartment, and to the hurried ejaculations of the
      terrified females, which led him almost instantly to hasten to their
      assistance. When he entered, he saw that the Queen had thrown herself into
      the large chair which stood nearest the door, and was sobbing for breath
      in a strong fit of hysterical affection. The elder female supported her in
      her arms, while the younger bathed her face with water and with tears
      alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasten, young man!&rdquo; said the elder lady, in alarm, &ldquo;fly&mdash;call in
      assistance&mdash;she is swooning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Queen ejaculated in a faint and broken voice, &ldquo;Stir not, I charge
      you!&mdash;call no one to witness&mdash;I am better&mdash;I shall recover
      instantly.&rdquo; And, indeed, with an effort which seemed like that of one
      struggling for life, she sate up in her chair, and endeavoured to resume
      her composure, while her features yet trembled with the violent emotion of
      body and mind which she had undergone. &ldquo;I am ashamed of my weakness,
      girls,&rdquo; she said, taking the hands of her attendants; &ldquo;but it is over&mdash;and
      I am Mary Stewart once more. The savage tone of that man's voice&mdash;my
      knowledge of his insolence&mdash;the name which he named&mdash;the purpose
      for which they come&mdash;may excuse a moment's weakness, and it shall be
      a moment's only.&rdquo; She snatched from her head the curch or cap, which had
      been disordered during her hysterical agony, shook down the thick
      clustered tresses of dark brown which had been before veiled under it&mdash;and,
      drawing her slender fingers across the labyrinth which they formed, she
      arose from the chair, and stood like the inspired image of a Grecian
      prophetess in a mood which partook at once of sorrow and pride, of smiles
      and of tears. &ldquo;We are ill appointed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to meet our rebel
      subjects; but, as far as we may, we will strive to present ourselves as
      becomes their Queen. Follow me, my maidens,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what says thy
      favourite song, my Fleming?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'My maids, come to my dressing-bower,
  And deck my nut-brown hair;
  Where'er ye laid a plait before,
  Look ye lay ten times 'mair.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she added, when she had repeated with a smile these lines of an
      old ballad, &ldquo;violence has already robbed me of the ordinary decorations of
      my rank; and the few that nature gave me have been destroyed by sorrow and
      by fear.&rdquo; Yet while she spoke thus, she again let her slender fingers
      stray through the wilderness of the beautiful tresses which veiled her
      kingly neck and swelling bosom, as if, in her agony of mind, she had not
      altogether lost the consciousness of her unrivalled charms. Roland Graeme,
      on whose youth, inexperience, and ardent sense of what was dignified and
      lovely, the demeanour of so fair and high-born a lady wrought like the
      charm of a magician, stood rooted to the spot with surprise and interest,
      longing to hazard his life in a quarrel so fair as that which Mary
      Stewart's must needs be. She had been bred in France&mdash;she was
      possessed of the most distinguished beauty&mdash;she had reigned a Queen
      and a Scottish Queen, to whom knowledge of character was as essential as
      the use of vital air. In all these capacities, Mary was, of all women on
      the earth, most alert at perceiving and using the advantages which her
      charms gave her over almost all who came within the sphere of their
      influence. She cast on Roland a glance which might have melted a heart of
      stone. &ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; she said, with a feeling partly real, partly
      politic, &ldquo;thou art a stranger to us&mdash;sent to this doleful captivity
      from the society of some tender mother, or sister, or maiden, with whom
      you had freedom to tread a gay measure round the Maypole. I grieve for
      you; but you are the only male in my limited household&mdash;wilt thou
      obey my orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the death, madam,&rdquo; said Graeme, in a determined tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then keep the door of mine apartment,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;keep it till they
      offer actual violence, or till we shall be fitly arrayed to receive these
      intrusive visiters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will defend it till they pass over my body,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; any
      hesitation which he had felt concerning the line of conduct he ought to
      pursue being completely swept away by the impulse of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, my good youth,&rdquo; answered Mary; &ldquo;not so, I command. If I have one
      faithful subject beside me, much need, God wot, I have to care for his
      safety. Resist them but till they are put to the shame of using actual
      violence, and then give way, I charge you. Remember my commands.&rdquo; And,
      with a smile expressive at once of favour and of authority, she turned
      from him, and, followed by her attendants, entered the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest paused for half a second ere she followed her companion, and
      made a signal to Roland Graeme with her hand. He had been already long
      aware that this was Catherine Seyton&mdash;a circumstance which could not
      much surprise a youth of quick intellects, who recollected the sort of
      mysterious discourse which had passed betwixt the two matrons at the
      deserted nunnery, and on which his meeting with Catherine in this place
      seemed to cast so much light. Yet such was the engrossing effect of Mary's
      presence, that it surmounted for the moment even the feelings of a
      youthful lover; and it was not until Catherine Seyton had disappeared,
      that Roland began to consider in what relation they were to stand to each
      other. &ldquo;She held up her hand to me in a commanding manner,&rdquo; he thought;
      &ldquo;perhaps she wanted to confirm my purpose for the execution of the Queen's
      commands; for I think she could scarce purpose to scare me with the sort
      of discipline which she administered to the groom in the frieze-jacket,
      and to poor Adam Woodcock. But we will see to that anon; meantime, let us
      do justice to the trust reposed in us by this unhappy Queen. I think my
      Lord of Murray will himself own that it is the duty of a faithful page to
      defend his lady against intrusion on her privacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he stepped to the little vestibule, made fast, with lock and
      bar, the door which opened from thence to the large staircase, and then
      sat himself down to attend the result. He had not long to wait&mdash;a
      rude and strong hand first essayed to lift the latch, then pushed and
      shook the door with violence, and, when it resisted his attempt to open
      it, exclaimed, &ldquo;Undo the door there, you within!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, and at whose command,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;am I to undo the door of the
      apartments of the Queen of Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another vain attempt, which made hinge and bolt jingle, showed that the
      impatient applicant without would willingly have entered altogether
      regardless of his challenge; but at length an answer was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undo the door, on your peril&mdash;the Lord Lindesay comes to speak with
      the Lady Mary of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord Lindesay, as a Scottish noble,&rdquo; answered the page, &ldquo;must await
      his Sovereign's leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An earnest altercation ensued amongst those without, in which Roland
      distinguished the remarkable harsh voice of Lindesay in reply to Sir
      Robert Melville, who appeared to have been using some soothing language&mdash;&ldquo;No!
      no! no! I tell thee, no! I will place a petard against the door rather
      than be baulked by a profligate woman, and bearded by an insolent
      footboy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, at least,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;let me try fair means in the first
      instance. Violence to a lady would stain your scutcheon for ever. Or await
      till my Lord Ruthven comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will await no longer,&rdquo; said Lindesay; &ldquo;it is high time the business
      were done, and we on our return to the council. But thou mayest try thy
      fair play, as thou callest it, while I cause my train to prepare the
      petard. I came hither provided with as good gunpowder as blew up the Kirk
      of Field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, be patient,&rdquo; said Melville; and, approaching the door, he
      said, as speaking to those within, &ldquo;Let the Queen know, that I, her
      faithful servant, Robert Melville, do entreat her, for her own sake, and
      to prevent worse consequences, that she will undo the door, and admit Lord
      Lindesay, who brings a mission from the Council of State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do your errand to the Queen,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;and report to you
      her answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door of the bedchamber, and tapping against it gently, it
      was opened by the elderly lady, to whom he communicated his errand, and
      returned with directions from the Queen to admit Sir Robert Melville and
      Lord Lindesay. Roland Graeme returned to the vestibule, and opened the
      door accordingly, into which the Lord Lindesay strode, with the air of a
      soldier who has fought his way into a conquered fortress; while Melville,
      deeply dejected, followed him more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I draw you to witness, and to record,&rdquo; said the page to this last, &ldquo;that,
      save for the especial commands of the Queen, I would have made good the
      entrance, with my best strength, and my best blood, against all Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, young man,&rdquo; said Melville, in a tone of grave rebuke; &ldquo;add not
      brands to fire&mdash;this is no time to make a flourish of thy boyish
      chivalry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not appeared even yet,&rdquo; said Lindesay, who had now reached the
      midst of the parlour or audience-room; &ldquo;how call you this trifling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, my lord,&rdquo; replied Sir Robert, &ldquo;time presses not&mdash;and Lord
      Ruthven hath not as yet descended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door of the inner apartment opened, and Queen Mary
      presented herself, advancing with an air of peculiar grace and majesty,
      and seeming totally unruffled, either by the visit, or by the rude manner
      in which it had been enforced. Her dress was a robe of black velvet; a
      small ruff, open in front, gave a full view of her beautifully formed chin
      and neck, but veiled the bosom. On her head she wore a small cap of lace,
      and a transparent white veil hung from her shoulders over the long black
      robe, in large loose folds, so that it could be drawn at pleasure over the
      face and person. She wore a cross of gold around her neck, and had her
      rosary of gold and ebony hanging from her girdle. She was closely followed
      by her two ladies, who remained standing behind her during the conference.
      Even Lord Lindesay, though the rudest noble of that rude age, was
      surprised into something like respect by the unconcerned and majestic mien
      of her, whom he had expected to find frantic with impotent passion, or
      dissolved in useless and vain sorrow, or overwhelmed with the fears likely
      in such a situation to assail fallen royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fear we have detained you, my Lord of Lindesay,&rdquo; said the Queen, while
      she curtsied with dignity in answer to his reluctant obeisance; &ldquo;but a
      female does not willingly receive her visiters without some minutes spent
      at the toilette. Men, my lord, are less dependant on such ceremonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lindesay, casting his eye down on his own travel-stained and
      disordered dress, muttered something of a hasty journey, and the Queen
      paid her greeting to Sir Robert Melville with courtesy, and even, as it
      seemed, with kindness. There was then a dead pause, during which Lindesay
      looked towards the door, as if expecting with impatience the colleague of
      their embassy. The Queen alone was entirely unembarrassed, and, as if to
      break the silence, she addressed Lord Lindesay, with a glance at the large
      and cumbrous sword which he wore, as already mentioned, hanging from his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have there a trusty and a weighty travelling companion, my lord. I
      trust you expected to meet with no enemy here, against whom such a
      formidable weapon could be necessary? it is, methinks, somewhat a singular
      ornament for a court, though I am, as I well need to be, too much of a
      Stuart to fear a sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the first time, madam,&rdquo; replied Lindesay, bringing round the
      weapon so as to rest its point on the ground, and leaning one hand on the
      huge cross-handle, &ldquo;it is not the first time that this weapon has intruded
      itself into the presence of the House of Stewart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, my lord,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;it may have done service to my
      ancestors&mdash;Your ancestors were men of loyalty&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;service it hath done; but such as kings love
      neither to acknowledge nor to reward. It was the service which the knife
      renders to the tree when trimming it to the quick, and depriving it of the
      superfluous growth of rank and unfruitful suckers, which rob it of
      nourishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk riddles, my lord,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;I will hope the explanation
      carries nothing insulting with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge, madam,&rdquo; answered Lindesay. &ldquo;With this good sword was
      Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, girded on the memorable day when he
      acquired the name of Bell-the-Cat, for dragging from the presence of your
      great grandfather, the third James of the race, a crew of minions,
      flatterers, and favourites whom he hanged over the bridge of Lauder, as a
      warning to such reptiles how they approach a Scottish throne. With this
      same weapon, the same inflexible champion of Scottish honour and nobility
      slew at one blow Spens of Kilspindie, a courtier of your grandfather,
      James the fourth, who had dared to speak lightly of him in the royal
      presence. They fought near the brook of Fala; and Bell-the-Cat, with this
      blade, sheared through the thigh of his opponent, and lopped the limb as
      easily as a shepherd's boy slices a twig from a sapling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied the Queen, reddening, &ldquo;my nerves are too good to be
      alarmed even by this terrible history&mdash;May I ask how a blade so
      illustrious passed from the House of Douglas to that of Lindesay?&mdash;Methinks
      it should have been preserved as a consecrated relic, by a family who have
      held all that they could do against their king, to be done in favour of
      their country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; said Melville, anxiously interfering, &ldquo;ask not that question
      of Lord Lindesay&mdash;And you, my lord, for shame&mdash;for decency&mdash;forbear
      to reply to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time that this lady should hear the truth,&rdquo; replied Lindesay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be assured,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;that she will be moved to anger by none
      that you can tell her, my lord. There are cases in which just scorn has
      always the mastery over just anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then know,&rdquo; said Lindesay, &ldquo;that upon the field of Carberry-hill, when
      that false and infamous traitor and murderer, James, sometime Earl of
      Bothwell, and nicknamed Duke of Orkney, offered to do personal battle with
      any of the associated nobles who came to drag him to justice, I accepted
      his challenge, and was by the noble Earl of Morton gifted with his good
      sword that I might therewith fight it out&mdash;Ah! so help me Heaven, had
      his presumption been one grain more, or his cowardice one grain less, I
      should have done such work with this good steel on his traitorous corpse,
      that the hounds and carrion-crows should have found their morsels daintily
      carved to their use !&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's courage well-nigh gave way at the mention of Bothwell's name&mdash;a
      name connected with such a train of guilt, shame, and disaster. But the
      prolonged boast of Lindesay gave her time to rally herself, and to answer
      with an appearance of cold contempt&mdash;&ldquo;It is easy to slay an enemy who
      enters not the lists. But had Mary Stewart inherited her father's sword as
      well as his sceptre, the boldest of her rebels should not upon that day
      have complained that they had no one to cope withal. Your lordship will
      forgive me if I abridge this conference. A brief description of a bloody
      fight is long enough to satisfy a lady's curiosity; and unless my Lord of
      Lindesay has something more important to tell us than of the deeds which
      old Bell-the-Cat achieved, and how he would himself have emulated them,
      had time and tide permitted, we will retire to our private apartment, and
      you, Fleming, shall finish reading to us yonder little treatise <i>Des
      Rodomontades Espagnolles</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarry, madam,&rdquo; said Lindesay, his complexion reddening in his turn, &ldquo;I
      know your quick wit too well of old to have sought an interview that you
      might sharpen its edge at the expense of my honour. Lord Ruthven and
      myself, with Sir Robert Melville as a concurrent, come to your Grace on
      the part of the Secret Council, to tender to you what much concerns the
      safety of your own life and the welfare of the State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Secret Council?&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;by what powers can it subsist or
      act, while I, from whom it holds its character, am here detained under
      unjust restraint? But it matters not&mdash;what concerns the welfare of
      Scotland shall be acceptable to Mary Stewart, come from whatever quarter
      it will&mdash;and for what concerns her own life, she has lived long
      enough to be weary of it, even at the age of twenty-five.&mdash;Where is
      your colleague, my lord?&mdash;why tarries he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes, madam,&rdquo; said Melville, and Lord Ruthven entered at the instant,
      holding in his hand a packet. As the Queen returned his salutation she
      became deadly pale, but instantly recovered herself by dint of strong and
      sudden resolution, just as the noble, whose appearance seemed to excite
      such emotions in her bosom, entered the apartment in company with George
      Douglas, the youngest son of the Knight of Lochleven, who, during the
      absence of his father and brethren, acted as Seneschal of the Castle,
      under the direction of the elder Lady Lochleven, his father's mother.

      Chapter the Twenty-Second.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I give this heavy weight from off my head,
  And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand;
  With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
  With mine own hand I give away my crown,
  With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
  With mine own breath release all duteous oaths.
                                   RICHARD II.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lord Ruthven had the look and bearing which became a soldier and a
      statesman, and the martial cast of his form and features procured him the
      popular epithet of Greysteil, by which he was distinguished by his
      intimates, after the hero of a metrical romance then generally known. His
      dress, which was a buff-coat embroidered, had a half-military character,
      but exhibited nothing of the sordid negligence which distinguished that of
      Lindesay. But the son of an ill-fated sire, and the father of a yet more
      unfortunate family, bore in his look that cast of inauspicious melancholy,
      by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those
      who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror which the presence of this nobleman impressed on the Queen's
      mind, arose from the active share he had borne in the slaughter of David
      Rizzio; his father having presided at the perpetration of that abominable
      crime, although so weak from long and wasting illness, that he could not
      endure the weight of his armour, having arisen from a sick-bed to commit a
      murder in the presence of his Sovereign. On that occasion his son also had
      attended and taken an active part. It was little to be wondered at, that
      the Queen, considering her condition when such a deed of horror was acted
      in her presence, should retain an instinctive terror for the principal
      actors in the murder. She returned, however, with grace the salutation of
      Lord Ruthven, and extended her hand to George Douglas, who kneeled, and
      kissed it with respect; the first mark of a subject's homage which Roland
      Graeme had seen any of them render to the captive Sovereign. She returned
      his greeting in silence, and there was a brief pause, during which the
      steward of the castle, a man of a sad brow and a severe eye, placed, under
      George Douglas's directions, a table and writing materials; and the page,
      obedient to his mistress's dumb signal, advanced a large chair to the side
      on which the Queen stood, the table thus forming a sort of bar which
      divided the Queen and her personal followers from her unwelcome visitors.
      The steward then withdrew after a low reverence. When he had closed the
      door behind him, the Queen broke silence&mdash;&ldquo;With your favour, my
      lords, I will sit&mdash;my walks are not indeed extensive enough at
      present to fatigue me greatly, yet I find repose something more necessary
      than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down accordingly, and, shading her cheek with her beautiful hand,
      looked keenly and impressively at each of the nobles in turn. Mary Fleming
      applied her kerchief to her eyes, and Catherine Seyton and Roland Graeme
      exchanged a glance, which showed that both were too deeply engrossed with
      sentiments of interest and commiseration for their royal mistress, to
      think of any thing which regarded themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wait the purpose of your mission, my lords,&rdquo; said the Queen, after she
      had been seated for about a minute without a word-being spoken,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wait your message from those you call the Secret Council.-I trust it is a
      petition of pardon, and a desire that I will resume my rightful throne,
      without using with due severity my right of punishing those who have
      dispossessed me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Ruthven, &ldquo;it is painful for us to speak harsh truths to a
      Princess who has long ruled us. But we come to offer, not to implore,
      pardon. In a word, madam, we have to propose to you on the part of the
      Secret Council, that you sign these deeds, which will contribute greatly
      to the pacification of the State, the advancement of God's word, and the
      welfare of your own future life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I expected to take these fair words on trust, my lord? or may I hear
      the contents of these reconciling papers, ere I am asked to sign them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably, madam; it is our purpose and wish, you should read what
      you are required to sign,&rdquo; replied Ruthven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Required?&rdquo; replied the Queen, with some emphasis; &ldquo;but the phrase suits
      well the matter-read, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Ruthven proceeded to read a formal instrument, running in the
      Queen's name, and setting forth that she had been called, at an early age,
      to the administration of the crown and realm of Scotland, and had toiled
      diligently therein, until she was in body and spirit so wearied out and
      disgusted, that she was unable any longer to endure the travail and pain
      of State affairs; and that since God had blessed her with a fair and
      hopeful son, she was desirous to ensure to him, even while she yet lived,
      his succession to the crown, which was his by right of hereditary descent.
      &ldquo;Wherefore,&rdquo; the instrument proceeded, &ldquo;we, of the motherly affection we
      bear to our said son, have renounced and demitted, and by these our
      letters of free good-will, renounce and demit, the Crown, government, and
      guiding of the realm of Scotland, in favour of our said son, that he may
      succeed to us as native Prince thereof, as much as if we had been removed
      by disease, and not by our own proper act. And that this demission of our
      royal authority may have the more full and solemn effect, and none pretend
      ignorance, we give, grant, and commit, fall and free and plain power to
      our trusty cousins, Lord Lindesay of the Byres, and William Lord Ruthven,
      to appear in our name before as many of the nobility, clergy, and
      burgesses, as may be assembled at Stirling, and there, in our name and
      behalf, publicly, and in their presence, to renounce the Crown, guidance,
      and government of this our kingdom of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen here broke in with an air of extreme surprise. &ldquo;How is this, my
      lords?&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Are my ears turned rebels, that they deceive me with
      sounds so extraordinary?&mdash;And yet it is no wonder that, having
      conversed so long with rebellion, they should now force its language upon
      my understanding. Say I am mistaken, my lords&mdash;say, for the honour of
      yourselves and the Scottish nobility, that my right trusty cousins of
      Lindesay and Ruthven, two barons of warlike fame and ancient line, have
      not sought the prison-house of their kind mistress for such a purpose as
      these words seem to imply. Say, for the sake of honour and loyalty, that
      my ears have deceived me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; said Ruthven gravely, &ldquo;your ears do <i>not</i> deceive you&mdash;they
      deceived you when they were closed against the preachers of the evangele,
      and the honest advice of your faithful subjects; and when they were ever
      open to flattery of pickthanks and traitors, foreign cubiculars and
      domestic minions. The land may no longer brook the rule of one who cannot
      rule herself; wherefore, I pray you to comply with the last remaining wish
      of your subjects and counsellors, and spare yourself and us the farther
      agitation of matter so painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this <i>all</i> my loving subjects require of me, my lord?&rdquo; said
      Mary, in a tone of bitter irony. &ldquo;Do they really stint themselves to the
      easy boon that I should yield up the crown, which is mine by birthright,
      to an infant which is scarcely more than a year old&mdash;fling down my
      sceptre, and take up a distaff&mdash;Oh no! it is too little for them to
      ask&mdash;That other roll of parchment contains something harder to be
      complied with, and which may more highly task my readiness to comply with
      the petitions of my lieges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This parchment,&rdquo; answered Ruthven, in the same tone of inflexible
      gravity, and unfolding the instrument as he spoke, &ldquo;is one by which your
      grace constitutes your nearest in blood, and the most honourable and
      trustworthy of your subjects, James, Earl of Murray, Regent of the kingdom
      during the minority of the young King. He already holds the appointment
      from the Secret Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen gave a sort of shriek, and, clapping her hands together,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Comes the arrow out of his quiver?&mdash;out of my brother's
      bow?&mdash;Alas! I looked for his return from France as my sole, at least
      my readiest, chance of deliverance.&mdash;And yet, when I heard he had
      assumed the government, I guessed he would shame to wield it in my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must pray your answer, madam,&rdquo; said Lord Ruthven, &ldquo;to the demand of the
      Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The demand of the Council!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;say rather the demand of a
      set of robbers, impatient to divide the spoil they have seized. To such a
      demand, and sent by the mouth of a traitor, whose scalp, but for my
      womanish mercy, should long since have stood on the city gates, Mary of
      Scotland has no answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, madam,&rdquo; said Lord Ruthven, &ldquo;my being unacceptable to your
      presence will not add to your obduracy of resolution. It may become you to
      remember that the death of the minion, Rizzio, cost the house of Ruthven
      its head and leader. My father, more worthy than a whole province of such
      vile sycophants, died in exile, and broken-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen clasped her hands on her face, and, resting her arms on the
      table, stooped down her head and wept so bitterly, that the tears were
      seen to find their way in streams between the white and slender fingers
      with which she endeavoured to conceal them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; said Sir Robert Melville, &ldquo;this is too much rigour. Under your
      lordship's favour, we came hither, not to revive old griefs, but to find
      the mode of avoiding new ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Robert Melville,&rdquo; said Ruthven, &ldquo;we best know for what purpose we
      were delegated hither, and wherefore you were somewhat unnecessarily sent
      to attend us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, by my hand,&rdquo; said Lord Lindesay, &ldquo;I know not why we were cumbered
      with the good knight, unless he comes in place of the lump of sugar which
      pothicars put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments, to please a
      froward child&mdash;a needless labour, methinks, where men have the means
      to make them swallow the physic otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my lords,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;ye best know your own secret
      instructions. I conceive I shall best obey mine in striving to mediate
      between her Grace and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, Sir Robert Melville,&rdquo; said the Queen, arising, and her face
      still glowing with agitation as she spoke. &ldquo;My kerchief, Fleming&mdash;I
      shame that traitors should have power to move me thus.&mdash;Tell me,
      proud lords,&rdquo; she added, wiping away the tears as she spoke, &ldquo;by what
      earthly warrant can liege subjects pretend to challenge the rights of an
      anointed Sovereign&mdash;to throw off the allegiance they have vowed, and
      to take away the crown from the head on which Divine warrant hath placed
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Ruthven, &ldquo;I will deal plainly with you. Your reign, from the
      dismal field of Pinkie-cleugh, when you were a babe in the cradle, till
      now that ye stand a grown dame before us, hath been such a tragedy of
      losses, disasters, civil dissensions, and foreign wars, that the like is
      not to be found in our chronicles. The French and English have, with one
      consent, made Scotland the battle-field on which to fight out their own
      ancient quarrel.&mdash;For ourselves every man's hand hath been against
      his brother, nor hath a year passed over without rebellion and slaughter,
      exile of nobles, and oppressing of the commons. We may endure it no
      longer, and therefore, as a prince, to whom God hath refused the gift of
      hearkening to wise counsel, and on whose dealings and projects no blessing
      hath ever descended, we pray you to give way to other rule and governance
      of the land, that a remnant may yet be saved to this distracted realm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;it seems to me that you fling on my unhappy and
      devoted head those evils, which, with far more justice, I may impute to
      your own turbulent, wild, and untameable dispositions&mdash;the frantic
      violence with which you, the Magnates of Scotland, enter into feuds
      against each other, sticking at no cruelty to gratify your wrath, taking
      deep revenge for the slightest offences, and setting at defiance those
      wise laws which your ancestors made for stanching of such cruelty,
      rebelling against the lawful authority, and bearing yourselves as if there
      were no king in the land; or rather as if each were king in his own
      premises. And now you throw the blame on me&mdash;on me, whose life has
      been embittered&mdash;whose sleep has been broken&mdash;whose happiness
      has been wrecked by your dissensions. Have I not myself been obliged to
      traverse wilds and mountains, at the head of a few faithful followers, to
      maintain peace and put down oppression? Have I not worn harness on my
      person, and carried pistols at my saddle; fain to lay aside the softness
      of a woman, and the dignity of a Queen, that I might show an example to my
      followers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We grant, madam,&rdquo; said Lindesay, &ldquo;that the affrays occasioned by your
      misgovernment, may sometimes have startled you in the midst of a masque or
      galliard; or it may be that such may have interrupted the idolatry of the
      mass, or the jesuitical counsels of some French ambassador. But the
      longest and severest journey which your Grace has taken in my memory, was
      from Hawick to Hermitage Castle; and whether it was for the weal of the
      state, or for your own honour, rests with your Grace's conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen turned to him with inexpressible sweetness of tone and manner,
      and that engaging look which Heaven had assigned her, as if to show that
      the choicest arts to win men's affections may be given in vain.
      &ldquo;Lindesay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you spoke not to me in this stern tone, and with
      such scurril taunt, yon fair summer evening, when you and I shot at the
      butts against the Earl of Mar and Mary Livingstone, and won of them the
      evening's collation, in the privy garden of Saint Andrews. The Master of
      Lindesay was then my friend, and vowed to be my soldier. How I have
      offended the Lord of Lindesay I know not, unless honours have changed
      manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardhearted as he was, Lindesay seemed struck with this unexpected appeal,
      but almost instantly replied, &ldquo;Madam, it is well known that your Grace
      could in those days make fools of whomever approached you. I pretend not
      to have been wiser than others. But gayer men and better courtiers soon
      jostled aside my rude homage, and I think your Grace cannot but remember
      times, when my awkward attempts to take the manners that pleased you, were
      the sport of the court-popinjays, the Marys and the Frenchwomen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I grieve if I have offended you through idle gaiety,&rdquo; said the
      Queen; &ldquo;and can but say it was most unwittingly done. You are fully
      revenged; for through gaiety,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;will I never offend
      any one more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our time is wasting, madam,&rdquo; said Lord Ruthven; &ldquo;I must pray your
      decision on this weighty matter which I have submitted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my lord!&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;upon the instant, and without a moment's
      time to deliberate?&mdash;Can the Council, as they term themselves, expect
      this of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Ruthven, &ldquo;the Council hold the opinion, that since the
      fatal term which passed betwixt the night of King Henry's murder and the
      day of Carberry-hill, your Grace should have held you prepared for the
      measure now proposed, as the easiest escape from your numerous dangers and
      difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen; &ldquo;and is it as a boon that you propose to
      me, what every Christian king ought to regard as a loss of honour equal to
      the loss of life!&mdash;You take from me my crown, my power, my subjects,
      my wealth, my state. What, in the name of every saint, can you offer, or
      do you offer, in requital of my compliance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We give you pardon,&rdquo; answered Ruthven, sternly&mdash;&ldquo;we give you space
      and means to spend your remaining life in penitence and seclusion&mdash;we
      give you time to make your peace with Heaven, and to receive the pure
      Gospel, which you have ever rejected and persecuted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen turned pale at the menace which this speech, as well as the
      rough and inflexible tones of the speaker, seemed distinctly to infer&mdash;&ldquo;And
      if I do not comply with your request so fiercely urged, my lord, what then
      follows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said this in a voice in which female and natural fear was contending
      with the feelings of insulted dignity.&mdash;There was a pause, as if no
      one cared to return to the question a distinct answer. At length Ruthven
      spoke: &ldquo;There is little need to tell to your Grace, who are well read both
      in the laws and in the chronicles of the realm, that murder and adultery
      are crimes for which ere now queens themselves have suffered death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where, my lord, or how, found you an accusation so horrible, against
      her who stands before you?&rdquo; said Queen Mary. &ldquo;The foul and odious
      calumnies which have poisoned the general mind of Scotland, and have
      placed me a helpless prisoner in your hands, are surely no proof of
      guilt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need look for no farther proof,&rdquo; replied the stern Lord Ruthven, &ldquo;than
      the shameless marriage betwixt the widow of the murdered and the leader of
      the band of murderers!&mdash;They that joined hands in the fated month of
      May, had already united hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded that
      marriage but a few brief weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, my lord!&rdquo; said the Queen, eagerly, &ldquo;remember well there were
      more consents than mine to that fatal union, that most unhappy act of a
      most unhappy life. The evil steps adopted by sovereigns are often the
      suggestion of bad counsellors; but these counsellors are worse than fiends
      who tempt and betray, if they themselves are the first to call their
      unfortunate princes to answer for the consequences of their own advice.&mdash;Heard
      ye never of a bond by the nobles, my lords, recommending that ill-fated
      union to the ill-fated Mary? Methinks, were it carefully examined, we
      should see that the names of Morton and of Lindesay, and of Ruthven, may
      be found in that bond, which pressed me to marry that unhappy man.&mdash;Ah!
      stout and loyal Lord Herries, who never knew guile or dishonour, you bent
      your noble knee to me in vain, to warn me of my danger, and wert yet the
      first to draw thy good sword in my cause when I suffered for neglecting
      thy counsel! Faithful knight and true noble, what a difference betwixt
      thee and those counsellors of evil, who now threaten my life for having
      fallen into the snares they spread for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Ruthven, &ldquo;we know that you are an orator; and perhaps for
      that reason the Council has sent hither men, whose converse hath been more
      with the wars, than with the language of the schools or the cabals of
      state. We but desire to know if, on assurance of life and honour, ye will
      demit the rule of this kingdom of Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what warrant have I,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;that ye will keep treaty with
      me, if I should barter my kingly estate for seclusion, and leave to weep
      in secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our honour and our word, madam,&rdquo; answered Ruthven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are too slight and unsolid pledges, my lord,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;add
      at least a handful of thistle-down to give them weight in the balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, Ruthven,&rdquo; said Lindesay; &ldquo;she was ever deaf to counsel, save of
      slaves and sycophants; let her remain by her refusal, and abide by it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, my lord,&rdquo; said Sir Robert Melville, &ldquo;or rather permit me to have
      but a few minutes' private audience with her Grace. If my presence with
      you could avail aught, it must be as a mediator&mdash;do not, I conjure
      you, leave the castle, or break off the conference, until I bring you word
      how her Grace shall finally stand disposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will remain in the hall,&rdquo; said Lindesay, &ldquo;for half an hour's space;
      but in despising our words and our pledge of honour, she has touched the
      honour of my name&mdash;let her look herself to the course she has to
      pursue. If the half hour should pass away without her determining to
      comply with the demands of the nation, her career will be brief enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With little ceremony the two nobles left the apartment, traversed the
      vestibule, and descended the winding-stairs, the clash of Lindesay's huge
      sword being heard as it rang against each step in his descent. George
      Douglas followed them, after exchanging with Melville a gesture of
      surprise and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were gone, the Queen, giving way to grief, fear, and
      agitation, threw herself into the seat, wrung her hands, and seemed to
      abandon herself to despair. Her female attendants, weeping themselves,
      endeavoured yet to pray her to be composed, and Sir Robert Melville,
      kneeling at her feet, made the same entreaty. After giving way to a
      passionate burst of sorrow, she at length said to Melville, &ldquo;Kneel not to
      me, Melville&mdash;mock me not with the homage of the person, when the
      heart is far away&mdash;Why stay you behind with the deposed, the
      condemned? her who has but few hours perchance to live? You have been
      favoured as well as the rest; why do you continue the empty show of
      gratitude and thankfulness any longer than they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Robert Melville, &ldquo;so help me Heaven at my need, my heart
      is as true to you as when you were in your highest place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True to me! true to me!&rdquo; repeated the Queen, with some scorn; &ldquo;tush,
      Melville, what signifies the truth which walks hand in hand with my
      enemies' falsehood?&mdash;thy hand and thy sword have never been so well
      acquainted that I can trust thee in aught where manhood is required&mdash;Oh,
      Seyton, for thy bold father, who is both wise, true, and valiant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme could withstand no longer his earnest desire to offer his
      services to a princess so distressed and so beautiful. &ldquo;If one sword,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;madam, can do any thing to back the wisdom of this grave
      counsellor, or to defend your rightful cause, here is my weapon, and here
      is my hand ready to draw and use it.&rdquo; And raising his sword with one hand,
      he laid the other upon the hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thus held up the weapon, Catherine Seyton exclaimed, &ldquo;Methinks I see
      a token from my father, madam;&rdquo; and immediately crossing the apartment,
      she took Roland Graeme by the skirt of the cloak, and asked him earnestly
      whence he had that sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page answered with surprise, &ldquo;Methinks this is no presence in which to
      jest&mdash;Surely, damsel, you yourself best know whence and how I
      obtained the weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a time for folly?&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton; &ldquo;unsheathe the sword
      instantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Queen commands me,&rdquo; said the youth, looking towards his royal
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, maiden!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;wouldst thou instigate the poor boy
      to enter into useless strife with the two most approved soldiers in
      Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your Grace's cause,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;I will venture my life upon
      them!&rdquo; And as he spoke, he drew his weapon partly from the sheath, and a
      piece of parchment, rolled around the blade, fell out and dropped on the
      floor. Catherine Seyton caught it up with eager haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my father's hand-writing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and doubtless conveys his
      best duteous advice to your Majesty; I know that it was prepared to be
      sent in this weapon, but I expected another messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith, fair one,&rdquo; thought Roland, &ldquo;and if you knew not that I had
      such a secret missive about me, I was yet more ignorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen cast her eye upon the scroll, and remained a few minutes wrapped
      in deep thought. &ldquo;Sir Robert Melville,&rdquo; she at length said, &ldquo;this scroll
      advises me to submit myself to necessity, and to subscribe the deeds these
      hard men have brought with them, as one who gives way to the natural fear
      inspired by the threats of rebels and murderers. You, Sir Robert, are a
      wise man, and Seyton is both sagacious and brave. Neither, I think, would
      mislead me in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;if I have not the strength of body of the Lord
      Herries or Seyton, I will yield to neither in zeal for your Majesty's
      service. I cannot fight for you like these lords, but neither of them is
      more willing to die for your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it, my old and faithful counsellor,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;and
      believe me, Melville, I did thee but a moment's injustice. Read what my
      Lord Seyton hath written to us, and give us thy best counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over the parchment, and instantly replied,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! my dear
      and royal mistress, only treason itself could give you other advice than
      Lord Seyton has here expressed. He, Herries, Huntly, the English
      ambassador Throgmorton, and others, your friends, are all alike of
      opinion, that whatever deeds or instruments you execute within these
      walls, must lose all force and effect, as extorted from your Grace by
      duresse, by sufferance of present evil, and fear of men, and harm to ensue
      on your refusal. Yield, therefore, to the tide, and be assured, that in
      subscribing what parchments they present to you, you bind yourself to
      nothing, since your act of signature wants that which alone can make it
      valid, the free will of the granter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so says my Lord Seyton,&rdquo; replied Mary; &ldquo;yet methinks, for the
      daughter of so long a line of sovereigns to resign her birthright, because
      rebels press upon her with threats, argues little of royalty, and will
      read ill for the fame of Mary in future chronicles. Tush! Sir Robert
      Melville, the traitors may use black threats and bold words, but they will
      not dare to put their hands forth on our person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam, they have already dared so far and incurred such peril by
      the lengths which they have gone, that they are but one step from the
      worst and uttermost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the Queen, her fears again predominating, &ldquo;Scottish nobles
      would not lend themselves to assassinate a helpless woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;what horrid spectacles have been seen
      in our day; and what act is so dark, that some Scottish hand has not been
      found to dare it? Lord Lindesay, besides his natural sullenness and
      hardness of temper, is the near kinsman of Henry Darnley, and Ruthven has
      his own deep and dangerous plans. The Council, besides, speak of proofs by
      writ and word, of a casket with letters&mdash;of I know not what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good Melville,&rdquo; answered the Queen, &ldquo;were I as sure of the
      even-handed integrity of my judges, as of my own innocence&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! pause, madam,&rdquo; said Melville; &ldquo;even innocence must sometimes for a
      season stoop to injurious blame. Besides, you are here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, Melville,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;never one approached my person who
      wished to work me evil; and even this poor page, whom I have to-day seen
      for the first time in my life, I can trust safely with your
      communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; answered Melville, &ldquo;in such emergence, and he being the
      bearer of Lord Seyton's message, I will venture to say, before him and
      these fair ladies, whose truth and fidelity I dispute not&mdash;I say I
      will venture to say, that there are other modes besides that of open
      trial, by which deposed sovereigns often die; and that, as Machiavel
      saith, there is but one step betwixt a king's prison and his grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I were it but swift and easy for the body,&rdquo; said the unfortunate
      Princess, &ldquo;were it but a safe and happy change for the soul, the woman
      lives not that would take the step so soon as I&mdash;But, alas! Melville,
      when we think of death, a thousand sins, which we have trod as worms
      beneath our feet, rise up against us as flaming serpents. Most injuriously
      do they accuse me of aiding Darnley's death; yet, blessed Lady! I afforded
      too open occasion for the suspicion&mdash;I espoused Bothwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of that now, madam,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;think rather of the
      immediate mode of saving yourself and son. Comply with the present
      unreasonable demands, and trust that better times will shortly arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;if it pleases you that I should do so, I
      will presently swim through the lake, if they refuse me other conveyance
      to the shore; I will go to the courts successively of England, France, and
      Spain, and will show you have subscribed these vile instruments from no
      stronger impulse than the fear of death, and I will do battle against them
      that say otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen turned her round, and with one of those sweet smiles which,
      during the era of life's romance, overpay every risk, held her hand
      towards Roland, but without &ldquo;speaking a word. He kneeled reverently, and
      kissed it, and Melville again resumed his plea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;time presses, and you must not let those boats, which I
      see they are even now preparing, put forth on the lake. Here are enough of
      witnesses&mdash;your ladies&mdash;this bold youth&mdash;myself, when it
      can serve your cause effectually, for I would not hastily stand committed
      in this matter&mdash;but even without me here is evidence enough to show,
      that you have yielded to the demands of the Council through force and
      fear, but from no sincere and unconstrained assent. Their boats are
      already manned for their return&mdash;oh! permit your old servant to
      recall them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melville,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;thou art an ancient courtier&mdash;when didst
      thou ever know a Sovereign Prince recall to his presence subjects who had
      parted from him on such terms as those on which these envoys of the
      Council left us, and who yet were recalled without submission or apology?&mdash;Let
      it cost me both life and crown, I will not again command them to my
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam, that empty form should make a barrier! If I rightly
      understand, you are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous
      counsel&mdash;but your scruple is saved&mdash;I hear them returning to ask
      your final resolution. Oh! take the advice of the noble Seyton, and you
      may once more command those who now usurp a triumph over you. But hush! I
      hear them in the vestibule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded speaking, George Douglas opened the door of the apartment,
      and marshalled in the two noble envoys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We come, madam,&rdquo; said the Lord Ruthven, &ldquo;to request your answer to the
      proposal of the Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your final answer,&rdquo; said Lord Lindesay; &ldquo;for with a refusal you must
      couple the certainty that you have precipitated your fate, and renounced
      the last opportunity of making peace with God, and ensuring your longer
      abode in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; said Mary, with inexpressible grace and dignity, &ldquo;the evils we
      cannot resist we must submit to&mdash;I will subscribe these parchments
      with such liberty of choice as my condition permits me. Were I on yonder
      shore, with a fleet jennet and ten good and loyal knights around me, I
      would subscribe my sentence of eternal condemnation as soon as the
      resignation of my throne. But here, in the Castle of Lochleven, with deep
      water around me&mdash;and you, my lords, beside me,&mdash;I have no
      freedom of choice.&mdash;Give me the pen, Melville, and bear witness to
      what I do, and why I do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our hope your Grace will not suppose yourself compelled by any
      apprehensions from us,&rdquo; said the Lord Ruthven, &ldquo;to execute what must be
      your own voluntary deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen had already stooped towards the table, and placed the parchment
      before her, with the pen between her fingers, ready for the important act
      of signature. But when Lord Ruthven had done speaking, she looked up,
      stopped short, and threw down the pen. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am expected to
      declare I give away my crown of free will, or otherwise than because I am
      compelled to renounce it by the threat of worse evils to myself and my
      subjects, I will not put my name to such an untruth&mdash;not to gain full
      possession of England, France, and Scotland!&mdash;all once my own, in
      possession, or by right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware, madam,&rdquo; said Lindesay, and, snatching hold of the Queen's arm
      with his own gauntleted hand, he pressed it, in the rudeness of his
      passion, more closely, perhaps, than he was himself aware of,&mdash;&ldquo;beware
      how you contend with those who are the stronger, and have the mastery of
      your fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held his grasp on her arm, bending his eyes on her with a stern and
      intimidating look, till both Ruthven and Melville cried shame; and
      Douglas, who had hitherto remained in a state of apparent apathy, had made
      a stride from the door, as if to interfere. The rude Baron then quitted
      his hold, disguising the confusion which he really felt at having indulged
      his passion to such extent, under a sullen and contemptuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen immediately began, with an expression of pain, to bare the arm
      which he had grasped, by drawing up the sleeve of her gown, and it
      appeared that his gripe had left the purple marks of his iron fingers upon
      her flesh&mdash;&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as a knight and gentleman, you might
      have spared my frail arm so severe a proof that you have the greater
      strength on your side, and are resolved to use it&mdash;But I thank you
      for it&mdash;it is the most decisive token of the terms on which this
      day's business is to rest.&mdash;I draw you to witness, both lords and
      ladies,&rdquo; she said, showing the marks of the grasp on her arm, &ldquo;that I
      subscribe these instruments in obedience to the sign manual of my Lord of
      Lindesay, which you may see imprinted on mine arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The details of this remarkable event are, as given in the
      preceding chapter, imaginary; but the outline of the events is historical.
      Sir Robert Lindesay, brother to the author of the Memoirs, was at first
      intrusted with the delicate commission of persuading the imprisoned queen
      to resign her crown. As he flatly refused to interfere, they determined to
      send the Lord Lindesay, one of the rudest and most violent of their own
      faction, with instructions, first to use fair persuasions, and if these
      did not succeed, to enter into harder terms. Knox associates Lord Ruthven
      with Lindesay in this alarming commission. He was the son of that Lord
      Ruthven who was prime agent in the murder of Rizzio; and little mercy was
      to be expected from his conjunction with Lindesay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employment of such rude tools argued a resolution on the part of those
      who had the Queen's person in their power, to proceed to the utmost
      extremities, should they find Mary obstinate. To avoid this pressing
      danger, Sir Robert Melville was despatched by them to Lochleven, carrying
      with him, concealed in the scabbard of his sword, letters to the Queen
      from the Earl of Athole, Maitland of Lethington, and even from
      Throgmorton, the English Ambassador, who was then favourable to the
      unfortunate Mary, conjuring her to yield to the necessity of the times,
      and to subscribe such deeds as Lindesay should lay before her, without
      being startled by their tenor; and assuring her that her doing so, in the
      state of captivity under which she was placed, would neither, in law,
      honour, nor conscience, be binding upon her when she should obtain her
      liberty. Submitting by the advice of one part of her subjects to the
      menace of the others, and learning that Lindesay was arrived in a
      boasting, that is, threatening humour, the Queen, &ldquo;with some reluctancy,
      and with tears,&rdquo; saith Knox, subscribed one deed resigning her crown to
      her infant son, and another establishing the Earl of Murray regent. It
      seems agreed by historians that Lindesay behaved with great brutality on
      the occasion. The deeds were signed 24th July, 1567.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindesay would have spoken, but was restrained by his colleague Ruthven,
      who said to him, &ldquo;Peace, my lord. Let the Lady Mary of Scotland ascribe
      her signature to what she will, it is our business to procure it, and
      carry it to the Council. Should there be debate hereafter on the manner in
      which it was adhibited, there will be time enough for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lindesay was silent accordingly, only muttering within his beard, &ldquo;I meant
      not to hurt her; but I think women's flesh be as tender as new-fallen
      snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen meanwhile subscribed the rolls of parchment with a hasty
      indifference, as if they had been matters of slight consequence, or of
      mere formality. When she had performed this painful task, she arose, and,
      having curtsied to the lords, was about to withdraw to her chamber.
      Ruthven and Sir Robert Melville made, the first a formal reverence, the
      second an obeisance, in which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy was
      obviously checked by the fear of appearing in the eyes of his colleagues
      too partial to his former mistress. But Lindesay stood motionless, even
      when they were preparing to withdraw. At length, as if moved by a sudden
      impulse, he walked round the table which had hitherto been betwixt them
      and the Queen, kneeled on one knee, took her hand, kissed it, let it fall,
      and arose&mdash;&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou art a noble creature, even though
      thou hast abused God's choicest gifts. I pay that devotion to thy
      manliness of spirit, which I would not have paid to the power thou hast
      long undeservedly wielded&mdash;I kneel to Mary Stewart, not to the
      Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen and Mary Stewart pity thee alike, Lindesay,&rdquo; said Mary&mdash;&ldquo;alike
      thee pity, and they forgive thee. An honoured soldier hadst thou been by a
      king's side&mdash;leagued with rebels, what art thou but a good blade in
      the hands of a ruffian?&mdash;Farewell, my Lord Ruthven, the smoother but
      the deeper traitor.&mdash;Farewell, Melville&mdash;Mayest thou find
      masters that can understand state policy better, and have the means to
      reward it more richly, than Mary Stewart.&mdash;Farewell, George of
      Douglas&mdash;make your respected grand-dame comprehend that we would be
      alone for the remainder of the day&mdash;God wot, we have need to collect
      our thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All bowed and withdrew; but scarce had they entered the vestibule, ere
      Ruthven and Lindesay were at variance. &ldquo;Chide not with me, Ruthven,&rdquo;
       Lindesay was heard to say, in answer to something more indistinctly urged
      by his colleague&mdash;&ldquo;Chide not with me, for I will not brook it! You
      put the hangman's office on me in this matter, and even the very hangman
      hath leave to ask some pardon of those on whom he does his office. I would
      I had as deep cause to be this lady's friend as I have to be her enemy&mdash;thou
      shouldst see if I spared limb and life in her quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a sweet minion,&rdquo; said Ruthven, &ldquo;to fight a lady's quarrel, and
      all for a brent brow and a tear in the eye! Such toys have been out of thy
      thoughts this many a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me right, Ruthven,&rdquo; said Lindesay. &ldquo;You are like a polished corslet of
      steel; it shines more gaudily, but it is not a whit softer&mdash;nay, it
      is five times harder than a Glasgow breastplate of hammered iron. Enough.
      We know each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the stairs, were heard to summon their boats, and the Queen
      signed to Roland Graeme to retire to the vestibule, and leave her with her
      female attendants.

                           THE WOODSMAN, A DRAMA.
</pre>
    <p>
      A recess in the vestibule was enlightened by a small window, at which
      Roland Graeme stationed himself to mark the departure of the lords. He
      could see their followers mustering on horseback under their respective
      banners&mdash;the western sun glancing on their corslets and steel-caps as
      they moved to and fro, mounted or dismounted, at intervals. On the narrow
      space betwixt the castle and the water, the Lords Ruthven and Lindesay
      were already moving slowly to their boats, accompanied by the Lady of
      Lochleven, her grandson, and their principal attendants. They took a
      ceremonious leave of each other, as Roland could discern by their
      gestures, and the boats put oft from their landing-place; the boatmen
      stretched to their oars, and they speedily diminished upon the eye of the
      idle gazer, who had no better employment than to watch their motions. Such
      seemed also the occupation of the Lady Lochleven and George Douglas, who,
      returning from the landing-place, looked frequently back to the boats, and
      at length stopped as if to observe their progress under the window at
      which Roland Graeme was stationed.&mdash;As they gazed on the lake, he
      could hear the lady distinctly say, &ldquo;And she has bent her mind to save her
      life at the expense of her kingdom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her life, madam!&rdquo; replied her son; &ldquo;I know not who would dare to attempt
      it in the castle of my father. Had I dreamt that it was with such purpose
      that Lindesay insisted on bringing his followers hither, neither he nor
      they should have passed the iron gate of Lochleven castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak not of private slaughter, my son, but of open trial,
      condemnation, and execution; for with such she has been threatened, and to
      such threats she has given way. Had she not more of the false Gusian blood
      than of the royal race of Scotland in her veins, she had bidden them
      defiance to their teeth&mdash;But it is all of the same complexion, and
      meanness is the natural companion of profligacy.&mdash;I am discharged,
      forsooth, from intruding on her gracious presence this evening. Go thou,
      my son, and render the usual service of the meal to this unqueened Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please you, lady mother,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;I care not greatly to
      approach her presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right, my son; and therefore I trust thy prudence, even because
      I have noted thy caution. She is like an isle on the ocean, surrounded
      with shelves and quicksands; its verdure fair and inviting to the eye, but
      the wreck of many a goodly vessel which hath approached it too rashly. But
      for thee, my son, I fear nought; and we may not, with our honour, suffer
      her to eat without the attendance of one of us. She may die by the
      judgment of Heaven, or the fiend may have power over her in her despair;
      and then we would be touched in honour to show that in our house, and at
      our table, she had had all fair play and fitting usage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Roland was interrupted by a smart tap on the shoulders, reminding him
      sharply of Adam Woodcock's adventure of the preceding evening. He turned
      round, almost expecting to see the page of Saint Michael's hostelry. He
      saw, indeed, Catherine Seyton; but she was in female attire, differing, no
      doubt, a great deal in shape and materials from that which she had worn
      when they first met, and becoming her birth as the daughter of a great
      baron, and her rank as the attendant on a princess. &ldquo;So, fair page,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;eaves-dropping is one of your page-like qualities, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair sister,&rdquo; answered Roland, in the same tone, &ldquo;if some friends of mine
      be as well acquainted with the rest of our mystery as they are with the
      arts of swearing, swaggering, and switching, they need ask no page in
      Christendom for farther insight into his vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless that pretty speech infer that you have yourself had the discipline
      of the switch since we last met, the probability whereof I nothing doubt,
      I profess, fair page, I am at a loss to conjecture your meaning. But there
      is no time to debate it now&mdash;they come with the evening meal. Be
      pleased, Sir Page, to do your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four servants entered bearing dishes, preceded by the same stern old
      steward whom Roland had already seen, and followed by George Douglas,
      already mentioned as the grandson of the Lady of Lochleven, and who,
      acting as seneschal, represented, upon this occasion, his father, the Lord
      of the Castle. He entered with his arms folded on his bosom, and his looks
      bent on the ground. With the assistance of Roland Graeme, a table was
      suitably covered in the next or middle apartment, on which the domestics
      placed their burdens with great reverence, the steward and Douglas bending
      low when they had seen the table properly adorned, as if their royal
      prisoner had sat at the board in question. The door opened, and Douglas,
      raising his eyes hastily, cast them again on the earth, when he perceived
      it was only the Lady Mary Fleming who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Grace,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will not eat to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope she may be otherwise persuaded,&rdquo; said Douglas; &ldquo;meanwhile,
      madam, please to see our duty performed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant presented bread and salt on a silver plate, and the old steward
      carved for Douglas a small morsel in succession from each of the dishes
      presented, which he tasted, as was then the custom at the tables of
      princes, to which death was often suspected to find its way in the
      disguise of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen will not then come forth to-night?&rdquo; said Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has so determined,&rdquo; replied the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our farther attendance then is unnecessary&mdash;we leave you to your
      supper, fair ladies, and wish you good even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He retired slowly as he came, and with the same air of deep dejection, and
      was followed by the attendants belonging to the castle. The two ladies
      sate down to their meal, and Roland Graeme, with ready alacrity, prepared
      to wait upon them. Catherine Seyton whispered to her companion, who
      replied with the question spoken in a low tone, but looking at the page&mdash;&ldquo;Is
      he of gentle blood and well nurtured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer which she received seemed satisfactory, for she said to Roland,
      &ldquo;Sit down, young gentleman, and eat with your sisters in captivity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me rather to perform my duty in attending them,&rdquo; said Roland,
      anxious to show he was possessed of the high tone of deference prescribed
      by the rules of chivalry towards the fair sex, and especially to dames and
      maidens of quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find, Sir Page,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;you will have little time
      allowed you for your meal; waste it not in ceremony, or you may rue your
      politeness ere to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your speech is too free, maiden,&rdquo; said the elder lady; &ldquo;the modesty of
      the youth may teach you more fitting fashions towards one whom to-day you
      have seen for the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine Seyton cast down her eyes, but not till she had given a single
      glance of inexpressible archness towards Roland, whom her more grave
      companion now addressed in a tone of protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regard her not, young gentleman&mdash;she knows little of the world, save
      the forms of a country nunnery&mdash;take thy place at the board-end, and
      refresh thyself after thy journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme obeyed willingly, as it was the first food he had that day
      tasted; for Lindesay and his followers seemed regardless of human wants.
      Yet, notwithstanding the sharpness of his appetite, a natural gallantry of
      disposition, the desire of showing himself a well-nurtured gentleman, in
      all courtesies towards the fair sex, and, for aught I know, the pleasure
      of assisting Catherine Seyton, kept his attention awake, during the meal,
      to all those nameless acts of duty and service which gallants of that age
      were accustomed to render. He carved with neatness and decorum, and
      selected duly whatever was most delicate to place before the ladies. Ere
      they could form a wish, he sprung from the table, ready to comply with it&mdash;poured
      wine&mdash;tempered it with water&mdash;removed the exchanged trenchers,
      and performed the whole honours of the table, with an air at once of
      cheerful diligence, profound respect, and graceful promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he observed that they had finished eating, he hastened to offer to
      the elder lady the silver ewer, basin, and napkin, with the ceremony and
      gravity which he would have used towards Mary herself. He next, with the
      same decorum, having supplied the basin with fair water, presented it to
      Catherine Seyton. Apparently, she was determined to disturb his
      self-possession, if possible; for, while in the act of bathing her hands,
      she contrived, as it were by accident, to flirt some drops of water upon
      the face of the assiduous assistant. But if such was her mischievous
      purpose she was completely disappointed; for Roland Graeme, internally
      piquing himself on his self-command, neither laughed nor was discomposed;
      and all that the maiden gained by her frolic was a severe rebuke from her
      companion, taxing her with mal-address and indecorum. Catherine replied
      not, but sat pouting, something in the humour of a spoilt child, who
      watches the opportunity of wreaking upon some one or other its resentment
      for a deserved reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Mary Fleming, in the mean-while, was naturally well pleased with
      the exact and reverent observance of the page, and said to Catherine,
      after a favourable glance at Roland Graeme,&mdash;&ldquo;You might well say,
      Catherine, our companion in captivity was well born and gentle nurtured. I
      would not make him vain by my praise, but his services enable us to
      dispense with those which George Douglas condescends not to afford us,
      save when the Queen is herself in presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! I think hardly,&rdquo; answered Catherine. &ldquo;George Douglas is one of the
      most handsome gallants in Scotland, and 'tis pleasure to see him even
      still, when the gloom of Lochleven Castle has shed the same melancholy
      over him, that it has done over every thing else. When he was at Holyrood
      who would have said the young sprightly George Douglas would have been
      contented to play the locksman here in Lochleven, with no gayer amusement
      than that of turning the key on two or three helpless women?&mdash;a
      strange office for a Knight of the Bleeding Heart&mdash;why does he not
      leave it to his father or his brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, like us, he has no choice,&rdquo; answered the Lady Fleming. &ldquo;But,
      Catherine, thou hast used thy brief space at court well, to remember what
      George Douglas was then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used mine eyes, which I suppose was what I was designed to do, and they
      were worth using there. When I was at the nunnery, they were very useless
      appurtenances; and now I am at Lochleven, they are good for nothing, save
      to look over that eternal work of embroidery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak thus, when you have been but a few brief hours amongst us&mdash;was
      this the maiden who would live and die in a dungeon, might she but have
      permission to wait on her gracious Queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, if you chide in earnest, my jest is ended,&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton.
      &ldquo;I would not yield in attachment to my poor god-mother, to the gravest
      dame that ever had wise saws upon her tongue, and a double-starched ruff
      around her throat&mdash;you know I would not, Dame Mary Fleming, and it is
      putting shame on me to say otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will challenge the other court lady,&rdquo; thought Roland Graeme; &ldquo;she
      will to a certainty fling down her glove, and if Dame Mary Fleming hath
      but the soul to lift it, we may have a combat in the lists!&rdquo;&mdash;but the
      answer of Lady Mary Fleming was such as turns away wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a good child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my Catherine, and a faithful; but
      Heaven pity him who shall have one day a creature so beautiful to delight
      him, and a thing so mischievous to torment him&mdash;thou art fit to drive
      twenty husbands stark mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Catherine, resuming the full career of her careless
      good-humour, &ldquo;he must be half-witted beforehand, that gives me such an
      opportunity. But I am glad you are not angry with me in sincerity,&rdquo;
       casting herself as she spoke into the arms of her friend, and continuing,
      with a tone of apologetic fondness, while she kissed her on either side of
      the face; &ldquo;you know, my dear Fleming, that I have to contend with both my
      father's lofty pride, and with my mother's high spirit&mdash;God bless
      them! they have left me these good qualities, having small portion to give
      besides, as times go&mdash;and so I am wilful and saucy; but let me remain
      only a week in this castle, and oh, my dear Fleming, my spirit will be as
      chastised and humble as thine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dame Mary Fleming's sense of dignity, and love of form, could not resist
      this affectionate appeal. She kissed Catherine Seyton in her turn
      affectionately; while, answering the last part of her speech, she said,
      &ldquo;Now Our Lady forbid, dear Catherine, that you should lose aught that is
      beseeming of what becomes so well your light heart and lively humour. Keep
      but your sharp wit on this side of madness, and it cannot but be a
      blessing to us. But let me go, mad wench&mdash;I hear her Grace touch her
      silver call.&rdquo; And, extricating herself from Catherine's grasp, she went
      towards the door of Queen Mary's apartment, from which was heard the low
      tone of a silver whistle, which, now only used by the boatswains in the
      navy, was then, for want of bells, the ordinary mode by which ladies, even
      of the very highest rank, summoned their domestics. When she had made two
      or three steps towards the door, however, she turned back, and advancing
      to the young couple whom she left together, she said, in a very serious
      though a low tone, &ldquo;I trust it is impossible that we can, any of us, or in
      any circumstances, forget, that, few as we are, we form the household of
      the Queen of Scotland; and that, in her calamity, all boyish mirth and
      childish jesting can only serve to give a great triumph to her enemies,
      who have already found their account in objecting to her the lightness of
      every idle folly, that the young and the gay practised in her court.&rdquo; So
      saying, she left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine Seyton seemed much struck with this remonstrance&mdash;She
      suffered herself to drop into the seat which she had quitted when she went
      to embrace Dame Mary Fleming, and for some time rested her brow upon her
      hands; while Roland Graeme looked at her earnestly, with a mixture of
      emotions which perhaps he himself could neither have analysed nor
      explained. As she raised her face slowly from the posture to which a
      momentary feeling of self-rebuke had depressed it, her eyes encountered
      those of Roland, and became gradually animated with their usual spirit of
      malicious drollery, which not unnaturally excited a similar expression in
      those of the equally volatile page. They sat for the space of two minutes,
      each looking at the other with great seriousness on their features, and
      much mirth in their eyes, until at length Catherine was the first to break
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I pray you, fair sir,&rdquo; she began, very demurely, &ldquo;to tell me what you
      see in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious and knowing as those
      with which it is your worship's pleasure to honour me? It would seem as if
      there were some wonderful confidence and intimacy betwixt us, fair sir, if
      one is to judge from your extremely cunning looks; and so help me, Our
      Lady, as I never saw you but twice in my life before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where were those happy occasions,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;if I may be bold
      enough to ask the question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the nunnery of St. Catherine's,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;in the first
      instance; and, in the second, during five minutes of a certain raid or
      foray which it was your pleasure to make into the lodging of my lord and
      father, Lord Seyton, from which, to my surprise, as probably to your own,
      you returned with a token of friendship and favour, instead of broken
      bones, which were the more probable reward of your intrusion, considering
      the prompt ire of the house of Seyton. I am deeply mortified,&rdquo; she added,
      ironically, &ldquo;that your recollection should require refreshment on a
      subject so important; and that my memory should be stronger than yours on
      such an occasion, is truly humiliating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own, memory is not so exactly correct, fair mistress,&rdquo; answered the
      page, &ldquo;seeing you have forgotten meeting the third, in the hostelrie of
      St. Michael's, when it pleased you to lay your switch across the face of
      my comrade, in order, I warrant, to show that, in the house of Seyton,
      neither the prompt ire of its descendants, nor the use of the doublet and
      hose, are subject to Salique law, or confined to the use of the males.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; answered Catherine, looking at him with great steadiness, and
      some surprise, &ldquo;unless your fair wits have forsaken you, I am at a loss
      what to conjecture of your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my troth, fair mistress,&rdquo; answered Roland, &ldquo;and were I as wise a
      warlock as Michael Scott, I could scarce riddle the dream you read me. Did
      I not see you last night in the hostelrie of St. Michael's?&mdash;Did you
      not bring me this sword, with command not to draw it save at the command
      of my native and rightful Sovereign? And have I not done as you required
      me? Or is the sword a piece of lath&mdash;my word a bulrush&mdash;my
      memory a dream&mdash;and my eyes good for nought&mdash;espials which
      corbies might pick out of my head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if your eyes serve you not more truly on other occasions than in your
      vision of St. Michael,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;I know not, the pain apart, that
      the corbies would do you any great injury in the deprivation&mdash;But
      hark, the bell&mdash;hush, for God's sake, we are interrupted.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel was right; for no sooner had the dull toll of the castle bell
      begun to resound through the vaulted apartment, than the door of the
      vestibule flew open, and the steward, with his severe countenance, his
      gold chain, and his white rod, entered the apartment, followed by the same
      train of domestics who had placed the dinner on the table, and who now,
      with the same ceremonious formality, began to remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward remained motionless as some old picture, while the domestics
      did their office; and when it was accomplished, every thing removed from
      the table, and the board itself taken from its tressels and disposed
      against the wall, he said aloud, without addressing any one in particular,
      and somewhat in the tone of a herald reading a proclamation, &ldquo;My noble
      lady, Dame Margaret Erskine, by marriage Douglas, lets the Lady Mary of
      Scotland and her attendants to wit, that a servant of the true evangele,
      her reverend chaplain, will to-night, as usual, expound, lecture, and
      catechise, according to the forms of the congregation of gospellers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark you, my friend, Mr. Dryfesdale,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;I understand this
      announcement is a nightly form of yours. Now, I pray you to remark, that
      the Lady Fleming and I&mdash;for I trust your insolent invitation concerns
      us only&mdash;have chosen Saint Peter's pathway to Heaven, so I see no one
      whom your godly exhortation, catechise, or lecture, can benefit, excepting
      this poor page, who, being in Satan's hand as well as yourself, had better
      worship with you than remain to cumber our better-advised devotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page was well-nigh giving a round denial to the assertions which this
      speech implied, when, remembering what had passed betwixt him and the
      Regent, and seeing Catherine's finger raised in a monitory fashion, he
      felt himself, as on former occasions at the Castle of Avenel, obliged to
      submit to the task of dissimulation, and followed Dryfesdale down to the
      castle chapel, where he assisted in the devotions of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain was named Elias Henderson. He was a man in the prime of life,
      and possessed of good natural parts, carefully improved by the best
      education which those times afforded. To these qualities were added a
      faculty of close and terse reasoning; and, at intervals, a flow of happy
      illustration and natural eloquence. The religious faith of Roland Graeme,
      as we have already had opportunity to observe, rested on no secure basis,
      but was entertained rather in obedience to his grandmother's behests, and
      his secret desire to contradict the chaplain of Avenel Castle, than from
      any fixed or steady reliance which he placed on the Romish creed. His
      ideas had been of late considerably enlarged by the scenes he had passed
      through; and feeling that there was shame in not understanding something
      of those political disputes betwixt the professors of the ancient and the
      reformed faith, he listened with more attention than it had hitherto been
      in his nature to yield on such occasions, to an animated discussion of
      some of the principal points of difference betwixt the churches. So passed
      away the first day in the Castle of Lochleven; and those which followed it
      were, for some time, of a very monotonous and uniform tenor.

      Chapter the Twenty-Fourth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Tis a weary life this&mdash;
  Vaults overhead, and grates and bars around me,
  And my sad hours spent with as sad companions,
  Whose thoughts are brooding: o'er their own mischances,
  Far, far too deeply to take part in mine.
                                      THE WOODSMAN.
</pre>
    <p>
      The course of life to which Mary and her little retinue were doomed, was
      in the last degree secluded and lonely, varied only as the weather
      permitted or rendered impossible the Queen's usual walk in the garden or
      on the battlements. The greater part of the morning she wrought with her
      ladies at those pieces of needlework, many of which still remain proofs of
      her indefatigable application. At such hours the page was permitted the
      freedom of the castle and islet; nay, he was sometimes invited to attend
      George Douglas when he went a-sporting upon the lake, or on its margin;
      opportunities of diversion which were only clouded by the remarkable
      melancholy which always seemed to brood on that gentleman's brow, and to
      mark his whole demeanour,&mdash;a sadness so profound, that Roland never
      observed him to smile, or to speak any word unconnected with the immediate
      object of their exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most pleasant part of Roland's day, was the occasional space which he
      was permitted to pass in personal attendance on the Queen and her ladies,
      together with the regular dinner-time, which he always spent with Dame
      Mary Fleming and Catharine Seyton. At these periods, he had frequent
      occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive imagination of the
      latter damsel, who was unwearied in her contrivances to amuse her
      mistress, and to banish, for a time at least, the melancholy which preyed
      on her bosom. She danced, she sung, she recited tales of ancient and
      modern times, with that heartfelt exertion of talent, of which the
      pleasure lies not in the vanity of displaying it to others, but in the
      enthusiastic consciousness that we possess it ourselves. And yet these
      high accomplishments were mixed with an air of rusticity and harebrained
      vivacity, which seemed rather to belong to some village maid, the coquette
      of the ring around the Maypole, than to the high-bred descendant of an
      ancient baron. A touch of audacity, altogether short of effrontery, and
      far less approaching to vulgarity, gave as it were a wildness to all that
      she did; and Mary, while defending her from some of the occasional
      censures of her grave companion, compared her to a trained singing-bird
      escaped from a cage, which practises in all the luxuriance of freedom, and
      in full possession of the greenwood bough, the airs which it had learned
      during its earlier captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments which the page was permitted to pass in the presence of this
      fascinating creature, danced so rapidly away, that, brief as they were,
      they compensated the weary dulness of all the rest of the day. The space
      of indulgence, however, was always brief, nor were any private interviews
      betwixt him and Catharine permitted, or even possible. Whether it were
      some special precaution respecting the Queen's household, or whether it
      were her general ideas of propriety, Dame Fleming seemed particularly
      attentive to prevent the young people from holding any separate
      correspondence together, and bestowed, for Catharine's sole benefit in
      this matter, the full stock of prudence and experience which she had
      acquired, when mother of the Queen's maidens of honour, and by which she
      had gained their hearty hatred. Casual meetings, however, could not be
      prevented, unless Catherine had been more desirous of shunning, or Roland
      Graeme less anxious in watching for them. A smile, a gibe, a sarcasm,
      disarmed of its severity by the arch look with which it was accompanied,
      was all that time permitted to pass between them on such occasions. But
      such passing interviews neither afforded means nor opportunity to renew
      the discussion of the circumstances attending their earlier acquaintance,
      nor to permit Roland to investigate more accurately the mysterious
      apparition of the page in the purple velvet cloak at the hostelrie of
      Saint Michael's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter months slipped heavily away, and spring was already advanced,
      when Roland Graeme observed a gradual change in the manners of his
      fellow-prisoners. Having no business of his own to attend to, and being,
      like those of his age, education, and degree, sufficiently curious
      concerning what passed around, he began by degrees to suspect, and finally
      to be convinced, that there was something in agitation among his
      companions in captivity, to which they did not desire that he should be
      privy. Nay, he became almost certain that, by some means unintelligible to
      him, Queen Mary held correspondence beyond the walls and waters which
      surrounded her prison-house, and that she nourished some secret hope of
      deliverance or escape. In the conversations betwixt her and her
      attendants, at which he was necessarily present, the Queen could not
      always avoid showing that she was acquainted with the events which were
      passing abroad in the world, and which he only heard through her report.
      He observed that she wrote more and worked less than had been her former
      custom, and that, as if desirous to lull suspicion asleep, she changed her
      manner towards the Lady Lochleven into one more gracious, and which seemed
      to express a resigned submission to her lot. &ldquo;They think I am blind,&rdquo; he
      said to himself, &ldquo;and that I am unfit to be trusted because I am so young,
      or it may be because I was sent hither by the Regent. Well!&mdash;be it so&mdash;they
      may be glad to confide in me in the long run; and Catherine Seyton, for as
      saucy as she is, may find me as safe a confidant as that sullen Douglas,
      whom she is always running after. It may be they are angry with me for
      listening to Master Elias Henderson; but it was their own fault for
      sending me there, and if the man speaks truth and good sense, and preaches
      only the word of God, he is as likely to be right as either Pope or
      Councils.&rdquo;

      It is probable that in this last conjecture, Roland Graeme had hit upon
      the real cause why the ladies had not intrusted him with their councils.
      He had of late had several conferences with Henderson on the subject of
      religion, and had given him to understand that he stood in need of his
      instructions, although he had not thought there was either prudence or
      necessity for confessing that hitherto he had held the tenets of the
      Church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elias Henderson, a keen propagator of the reformed faith, had sought the
      seclusion of Lochleven Castle, with the express purpose and expectation of
      making converts from Rome amongst the domestics of the dethroned Queen,
      and confirming the faith of those who already held the Protestant
      doctrines. Perhaps his hopes soared a little higher, and he might nourish
      some expectation of a proselyte more distinguished in the person of the
      deposed Queen. But the pertinacity with which she and her female
      attendants refused to see or listen to him, rendered such hope, if he
      nourished it, altogether abortive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity, therefore, of enlarging the religious information of
      Roland Graeme, and bringing him to a more due sense of his duties to
      Heaven, was hailed by the good man as a door opened by Providence for the
      salvation of a sinner. He dreamed not, indeed, that he was converting a
      Papist, but such was the ignorance which Roland displayed upon some
      material points of the reformed doctrine, that Master Henderson, while
      praising his docility to the Lady Lochleven and her grandson, seldom
      failed to add, that his venerable brother, Henry Warden, must be now
      decayed in strength and in mind, since he found a catechumen of his flock
      so ill-grounded in the principles of his belief. For this, indeed, Roland
      Graeme thought it was unnecessary to assign the true reason, which was his
      having made it a point of honour to forget all that Henry Warden taught
      him, as soon as he was no longer compelled to read it over as a lesson
      acquired by rote. The lessons of his new instructor, if not more
      impressively delivered, were received by a more willing ear, and a more
      awakened understanding, and the solitude of Lochleven Castle was
      favourable to graver thoughts than the page had hitherto entertained. He
      wavered yet, indeed, as one who was almost persuaded; but his attention to
      the chaplain's instructions procured him favour even with the stern old
      dame herself; and he was once or twice, but under great precaution,
      permitted to go to the neighbouring village of Kinross, situated on the
      mainland, to execute some ordinary commission of his unfortunate mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Roland Graeme might be considered as standing neuter betwixt
      the two parties who inhabited the water-girdled Tower of Lochleven; but,
      as he rose in the opinion of the Lady of the Castle and her chaplain, he
      perceived, with great grief, that he lost ground in that of Mary and her
      female allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came gradually to be sensible that he was regarded as a spy upon their
      discourse, and that, instead of the ease with which they had formerly
      conversed in his presence, without suppressing any of the natural feelings
      of anger, of sorrow, or mirth, which the chance topic of the moment
      happened to call forth, their talk was now guardedly restricted to the
      most indifferent subjects, and a studied reserve observed even in their
      mode of treating these. This obvious want of confidence was accompanied
      with a correspondent change in their personal demeanor towards the
      unfortunate page. The Queen, who had at first treated him with marked
      courtesy, now scarce spoke to him, save to convey some necessary command
      for her service. The Lady Fleming restricted her notice to the most dry
      and distant expressions of civility, and Catherine Seyton became bitter in
      her pleasantries, and shy, cross, and pettish, in any intercourse they had
      together. What was yet more provoking, he saw, or thought he saw, marks of
      intelligence betwixt George Douglas and the beautiful Catherine Seyton;
      and, sharpened by jealousy, he wrought himself almost into a certainty,
      that the looks which they exchanged, conveyed matters of deep and serious
      import. &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if, courted by the son of a proud and
      powerful baron, she can no longer spare a word or look to the poor
      fortuneless page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Roland Graeme's situation became truly disagreeable, and his
      heart naturally enough rebelled against the injustice of this treatment,
      which deprived him of the only comfort which he had received for
      submitting to a confinement in other respects irksome. He accused Queen
      Mary and Catherine Seyton (for concerning the opinion of Dame Fleming he
      was indifferent) of inconsistency in being displeased with him on account
      of the natural consequences of an order of their own. Why did they send
      him to hear this overpowering preacher? The Abbot Ambrosius, he
      recollected, understood the weakness of their Popish cause better, when he
      enjoined him to repeat within his own mind, <i>aves</i>, and <i>credos</i>,
      and <i>paters</i>, all the while old Henry Warden preached or lectured,
      that so he might secure himself against lending even a momentary ear to
      his heretical doctrine. &ldquo;But I will endure this life no longer,&rdquo; said he
      to himself, manfully; &ldquo;do they suppose I would betray my mistress, because
      I see cause to doubt of her religion?&mdash;that would be a serving, as
      they say, the devil for God's sake. I will forth into the world&mdash;he
      that serves fair ladies, may at least expect kind looks and kind words;
      and I bear not the mind of a gentleman, to submit to cold treatment and
      suspicion, and a life-long captivity besides. I will speak to George
      Douglas to-morrow when we go out a-fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sleepless night was spent in agitating this magnanimous resolution, and
      he arose in the morning not perfectly decided in his own mind whether he
      should abide by it or not. It happened that he was summoned by the Queen
      at an unusual hour, and just as he was about to go out with George
      Douglas. He went to attend her commands in, the garden; but as he had his
      angling-rod in his hand, the circumstance announced his previous
      intention, and the Queen, turning to the Lady Fleming, said, &ldquo;Catherine
      must devise some other amusement for us, <i>ma bonnie amie</i>; our
      discreet page has already made his party for the day's pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said from the beginning,&rdquo; answered the Lady Fleming, &ldquo;that your Grace
      ought not to rely on being favoured with the company of a youth who has so
      many Huguenot acquaintances, and has the means of amusing himself far more
      agreeably than with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Catherine, her animated features reddening with
      mortification, &ldquo;that his friends would sail away with him for good, and
      bring us in return a page (if such a thing can be found) faithful to his
      Queen and to his religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One part of your wishes may be granted, madam,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme,
      unable any longer to restrain his sense of the treatment which he received
      on all sides; and he was about to add, &ldquo;I heartily wish you a companion in
      my room, if such can be found, who is capable of enduring women's caprices
      without going distracted.&rdquo; Luckily, he recollected the remorse which he
      had felt at having given way to the vivacity of his temper upon a similar
      occasion; and, closing his lips, imprisoned, until it died on his tongue,
      a reproach so misbecoming the presence of majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you remain there,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;as if you were rooted to the
      parterre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I but attend your Grace's commands,&rdquo; said the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none to give you&mdash;Begone, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he left the garden to go to the boat, he distinctly heard Mary upbraid
      one of her attendants in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;You see to what you have
      exposed us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brief scene at once determined Roland Graeme's resolution to quit the
      castle, if it were possible, and to impart his resolution to George
      Douglas without loss of time. That gentleman, in his usual mood of
      silence, sate in the stern of the little skiff which they used on such
      occasions, trimming his fishing-tackle, and, from time to time, indicating
      by signs to Graeme, who pulled the oars, which way he should row. When
      they were a furlong or two from the castle, Roland rested on the oars, and
      addressed his companion somewhat abruptly,&mdash;&ldquo;I have something of
      importance to say to you, under your pleasure, fair sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pensive melancholy of Douglas's countenance at once gave way to the
      eager, keen, and startled look of one who expects to hear something of
      deep and alarming import.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wearied to the very death of this Castle of Lochleven,&rdquo; continued
      Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Douglas; &ldquo;I know none of its inhabitants who are much
      better pleased with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I am neither a native of the house, nor a prisoner in it, and so
      I may reasonably desire to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might desire to quit it with equal reason,&rdquo; answered Douglas, &ldquo;if you
      were both the one and the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I am not only tired of living in Lochleven
      Castle, but I am determined to quit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a resolution more easily taken than executed,&rdquo; replied Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if yourself, sir, and your Lady Mother, choose to consent,&rdquo; answered
      the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake the matter, Roland,&rdquo; said Douglas; &ldquo;you will find that the
      consent of two other persons is equally essential&mdash;that of the Lady
      Mary your mistress, and that of my uncle the Regent, who placed you about
      her person, and who will not think it proper that she should change her
      attendants so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And must I then remain whether I will or no?&rdquo; demanded the page, somewhat
      appalled at a view of the subject, which would have occurred sooner to a
      person of more experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said George Douglas, &ldquo;you must will to remain till my uncle
      consents to dismiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;and speaking to you as a gentleman who is
      incapable of betraying me, I will confess, that if I thought myself a
      prisoner here, neither walls nor water should confine me long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;I could not much blame you for the attempt; yet,
      for all that, my father, or uncle, or the earl, or any of my brothers, or
      in short any of the king's lords into whose hands you fell, would in such
      a case hang you like a dog, or like a sentinel who deserts his post; and I
      promise you that you will hardly escape them. But row towards Saint Serf's
      island&mdash;there is a breeze from the west, and we shall have sport,
      keeping to windward of the isle, where the ripple is strongest. We will
      speak more of what you have mentioned when we have had an hour's sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their fishing was successful, though never did two anglers pursue even
      that silent and unsocial pleasure with less of verbal intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their time was expired, Douglas took the oars in his turn, and by his
      order Roland Graeme steered the boat, directing her course upon the
      landing-place at the castle. But he also stopped in the midst of his
      course, and, looking around him, said to Graeme, &ldquo;There is a thing which I
      could mention to thee; but it is so deep a secret, that even here,
      surrounded as we are by sea and sky, without the possibility of a
      listener, I cannot prevail on myself to speak it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better leave it unspoken, sir,&rdquo; answered Roland Graeme, &ldquo;if you doubt the
      honour of him who alone can hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt not your honour,&rdquo; replied George Douglas; &ldquo;but you are young,
      imprudent, and changeful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;I am, and it may be imprudent&mdash;but who hath
      informed you that I am changeful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that knows you, perhaps, better than you know yourself,&rdquo; replied
      Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean Catherine Seyton,&rdquo; said the page, his heart rising as
      he spoke; &ldquo;but she is herself fifty times more variable in her humour than
      the very water which we are floating upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young acquaintance,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;I pray you to remember that
      Catherine Seyton is a lady of blood and birth, and must not be lightly
      spoken of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master George of Douglas,&rdquo; said Graeme, &ldquo;as that speech seemed to be made
      under the warrant of something like a threat, I pray you to observe, that
      I value not the threat at the estimation of a fin of one of these dead
      trouts; and, moreover, I would have you to know that the champion who
      undertakes the defence of every lady of blood and birth, whom men accuse
      of change of faith and of fashion, is like to have enough of work on his
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said the Seneschal, but in a tone of good-humour, &ldquo;thou art a
      foolish boy, unfit to deal with any matter more serious than the casting
      of a net, or the flying of a hawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your secret concern Catherine Seyton,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I care not for
      it, and so you may tell her if you will. I wot she can shape you
      opportunity to speak with her, as she has ere now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flush which passed over Douglas's face, made the page aware that he
      had alighted on a truth, when he was, in fact, speaking at random; and the
      feeling that he had done so, was like striking a dagger into his own
      heart. His companion, without farther answer, resumed the oars, and pulled
      lustily till they arrived at the island and the castle. The servants
      received the produce of their spoil, and the two fishers, turning from
      each other in silence, went each to his several apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme had spent about an hour in grumbling against Catherine
      Seyton, the Queen, the Regent, and the whole house of Lochleven, with
      George Douglas at the head of it, when the time approached that his duty
      called him to attend the meal of Queen Mary. As he arranged his dress for
      this purpose, he grudged the trouble, which, on similar occasions, he
      used, with boyish foppery, to consider as one of the most important duties
      of his day; and when he went to take his place behind the chair of the
      Queen, it was with an air of offended dignity, which could not escape her
      observation, and probably appeared to her ridiculous enough, for she
      whispered something in French to her ladies, at which the lady Fleming
      laughed, and Catherine appeared half diverted and half disconcerted. This
      pleasantry, of which the subject was concealed from him, the unfortunate
      page received, of course, as a new offence, and called an additional
      degree of sullen dignity into his mien, which might have exposed him to
      farther raillery, but that Mary appeared disposed to make allowance for
      and compassionate his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the peculiar tact and delicacy which no woman possessed in greater
      perfection, she began to soothe by degrees the vexed spirit of her
      magnanimous attendant. The excellence of the fish which he had taken in
      his expedition, the high flavour and beautiful red colour of the trouts,
      which have long given distinction to the lake, led her first to express
      her thanks to her attendant for so agreeable an addition to her table,
      especially upon a <i>jour de jeune</i>; and then brought on inquiries into
      the place where the fish had been taken, their size, their peculiarities,
      the times when they were in season, and a comparison between the Lochleven
      trouts and those which are found in the lakes and rivers of the south of
      Scotland. The ill humour of Roland Graeme was never of an obstinate
      character. It rolled away like mist before the sun, and he was easily
      engaged in a keen and animated dissertation about Lochleven trout, and sea
      trout, and river trout, and bull trout, and char, which never rise to a
      fly, and par, which some suppose infant salmon, and <i>herlings</i>, which
      frequent the Nith, and <i>vendisses</i>, which are only found in the
      Castle-Loch of Lochmaben; and he was hurrying on with the eager
      impetuosity and enthusiasm of a young sportsman, when he observed that the
      smile with which the Queen at first listened to him died languidly away,
      and that, in spite of her efforts to suppress them, tears rose to her
      eyes. He stopped suddenly short, and, distressed in his turn, asked, &ldquo;If
      he had the misfortune unwittingly to give displeasure to her Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my poor boy,&rdquo; replied the Queen; &ldquo;but as you numbered up the lakes
      and rivers of my kingdom, imagination cheated me, as it will do, and
      snatched me from these dreary walls away to the romantic streams of
      Nithsdale, and the royal towers of Lochmaben.&mdash;O land, which my
      fathers have so long ruled! of the pleasures which you extend so freely,
      your Queen is now deprived, and the poorest beggar, who may wander free
      from one landward town to another, would scorn to change fates with Mary
      of Scotland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness,&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming, &ldquo;will do well to withdraw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, then, Fleming,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I would not burden hearts
      so young as these are, with the sight of my sorrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She accompanied these words with a look of melancholy compassion towards
      Roland and Catherine, who were now left alone together in the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page found his situation not a little embarrassing; for, as every
      reader has experienced who may have chanced to be in such a situation, it
      is extremely difficult to maintain the full dignity of an offended person
      in the presence of a beautiful girl, whatever reason we may have for being
      angry with her. Catherine Seyton, on her part, sate still like a lingering
      ghost, which, conscious of the awe which its presence imposes, is
      charitably disposed to give the poor confused mortal whom it visits, time
      to recover his senses, and comply with the grand rule of demonology by
      speaking first. But as Roland seemed in no hurry to avail himself of her
      condescension, she carried it a step farther, and herself opened the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, fair sir, if it may be permitted me to disturb your august
      reverie by a question so simple,&mdash;what may have become of your
      rosary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lost, madam&mdash;lost some time since,&rdquo; said Roland, partly
      embarrassed and partly indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask farther, sir,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;why you have not replaced
      it with another?&mdash;I have half a mind,&rdquo; she said, taking from her
      pocket a string of ebony beads adorned with gold, &ldquo;to bestow one upon you,
      to keep for my sake, just to remind you of former acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little tremulous accent in the tone with which these words
      were delivered, which at once put to flight Roland Graeme's resentment,
      and brought him to Catherine's side; but she instantly resumed the bold
      and firm accent which was more familiar to her. &ldquo;I did not bid you,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;come and sit so close by me; for the acquaintance that I spoke of,
      has been stiff and cold, dead and buried, for this many a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Heaven forbid!&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;it has only slept, and now that you
      desire it should awake, fair Catherine, believe me that a pledge of your
      returning favour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Catherine, withholding the rosary, towards which, as he
      spoke, he extended his hand, &ldquo;I have changed my mind on better reflection.
      What should a heretic do with these holy beads, that have been blessed by
      the father of the church himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland winced grievously, for he saw plainly which way the discourse was
      now likely to tend, and felt that it must at all events be embarrassing.
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was as a token of your own regard that you
      offered them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, fair sir, but that regard attended the faithful subject, the loyal
      and pious Catholic, the individual who was so solemnly devoted at the same
      time with myself to the same grand duty; which, you must now understand,
      was to serve the church and Queen. To such a person, if you ever heard of
      him, was my regard due, and not to him who associates with heretics, and
      is about to become a renegado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should scarce believe, fair mistress,&rdquo; said Roland, indignantly, &ldquo;that
      the vane of your favour turned only to a Catholic wind, considering that
      it points so plainly to George Douglas, who, I think, is both kingsman and
      Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think better of George Douglas,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;than to believe&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then checking herself, as if she had spoken too much, she went on, &ldquo;I
      assure you, fair Master Roland, that all who wish you well are sorry for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their number is very few, I believe,&rdquo; answered Roland, &ldquo;and their sorrow,
      if they feel any, not deeper than ten minutes' time will cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are more numerous, and think more deeply concerning you, than you
      seem to be aware,&rdquo; answered Catherine. &ldquo;But perhaps they think wrong&mdash;You
      are the best judge in your own affairs; and if you prefer gold and
      church-lands to honour and loyalty, and the faith of your fathers, why
      should you be hampered in conscience more than others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven bear witness for me,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;that if I entertain any
      difference of opinion&mdash;that is, if I nourish any doubts in point of
      religion, they have been adopted on the conviction of my own mind, and the
      suggestion of my own conscience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, your conscience&mdash;your conscience!&rdquo; repeated she with satiric
      emphasis; &ldquo;your conscience is the scape-goat; I warrant it an able one&mdash;it
      will bear the burden of one of the best manors of the Abbey of Saint Mary
      of Kennaquhair, lately forfeited to our noble Lord the King, by the Abbot
      and community thereof, for the high crime of fidelity to their religious
      vows, and now to be granted by the High and Mighty Traitor, and so forth,
      James Earl of Murray, to the good squire of dames Roland Graeme, for his
      loyal and faithful service as under-espial, and deputy-turnkey, for
      securing the person of his lawful sovereign, Queen Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misconstrue me cruelly,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;yes, Catherine, most cruelly&mdash;God
      knows I would protect this poor lady at the risk of my life, or with my
      life; but what can I do&mdash;what can any one do for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much may be done&mdash;enough may be done&mdash;all may be done&mdash;if
      men will be but true and honourable, as Scottish men were in the days of
      Bruce and Wallace. Oh, Roland, from what an enterprise you are now
      withdrawing your heart and hand, through mere fickleness and coldness of
      spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I withdraw,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;from an enterprise which has never
      been communicated to me?&mdash;Has the Queen, or have you, or has any one,
      communicated with me upon any thing for her service which I have refused?
      Or have you not, all of you, held me at such distance from your counsels,
      as if I were the most faithless spy since the days of Ganelon?&rdquo; [Footnote:
      Gan, Gano, or Ganelon of Mayence, is in the Romances on the subject of
      Charlemagne and his Paladins, always represented as the traitor by whom
      the Christian champions are betrayed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton, &ldquo;would trust the sworn friend, and
      pupil, and companion, of the heretic preacher Henderson? ay&mdash;a proper
      tutor you have chosen, instead of the excellent Ambrosius, who is now
      turned out of house and homestead, if indeed he is not languishing in a
      dungeon, for withstanding the tyranny of Morton, to whose brother the
      temporalities of that noble house of God have been gifted away by the
      Regent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;and is the excellent Father Ambrose in
      such distress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would account the news of your falling away from the faith of your
      fathers,&rdquo; answered Catherine, &ldquo;a worse mishap than aught that tyranny can
      inflict on himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said Roland, very much moved, &ldquo;why should you suppose that&mdash;that&mdash;that
      it is with me as you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you yourself deny it?&rdquo; replied Catherine; &ldquo;do you not admit that you
      have drunk the poison which you should have dashed from your lips?&mdash;Do
      you deny that it now ferments in your veins, if it has not altogether
      corrupted the springs of life?&mdash;Do you deny that you have your
      doubts, as you proudly term them, respecting what popes and councils have
      declared it unlawful to doubt of?&mdash;Is not your faith wavering, if not
      overthrown?&mdash;Does not the heretic preacher boast his conquest?&mdash;Does
      not the heretic woman of this prison-house hold up thy example to others?&mdash;Do
      not the Queen and the Lady Fleming believe in thy falling away?&mdash;And
      is there any except one&mdash;yes, I will speak it out, and think as
      lightly as you please of my good-will&mdash;is there one except myself
      that holds even a lingering hope that you may yet prove what we once all
      believed of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said our poor page, much embarrassed by the view which was
      thus presented to him of the conduct he was expected to pursue, and by a
      person in whom he was not the less interested that, though long a resident
      in Lochleven Castle, with no object so likely to attract his undivided
      attention, no lengthened interview had taken place since they had first
      met,&mdash;&ldquo;I know not what you expect of me, or fear from me. I was sent
      hither to attend Queen Mary, and to her I acknowledge the duty of a
      servant through life and death. If any one had expected service of another
      kind, I was not the party to render it. I neither avow nor disclaim the
      doctrines of the reformed church.&mdash;Will you have the truth?&mdash;It
      seems to me that the profligacy of the Catholic clergy has brought this
      judgment on their own heads, and, for aught I know, it may be for their
      reformation. But, for betraying this unhappy Queen, God knows I am
      guiltless of the thought. Did I even believe worse of her, than as her
      servant I wish&mdash;as her subject I dare to do&mdash;I would not betray
      her&mdash;far from it&mdash;I would aid her in aught which could tend to a
      fair trial of her cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! enough!&rdquo; answered Catherine, clasping her hands together; &ldquo;then
      thou wilt not desert us if any means are presented, by which, placing our
      Royal Mistress at freedom, this case may be honestly tried betwixt her and
      her rebellious subjects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay&mdash;but, fair Catherine,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;hear but what the Lord
      of Murray said when he sent me hither.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear but what the devil said,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;rather than what a
      false subject, a false brother, a false counsellor, a false friend, said!
      A man raised from a petty pensioner on the crown's bounty, to be the
      counsellor of majesty, and the prime distributor of the bounties of the
      state;&mdash;one with whom rank, fortune, title, consequence, and power,
      all grew up like a mushroom, by the mere warm good-will of the sister,
      whom, in requital, he hath mewed up in this place of melancholy seclusion&mdash;whom,
      in farther requital, he has deposed, and whom, if he dared, he would
      murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not so ill of the Earl of Murray,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;and sooth
      to speak,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;it would require some bribe to make me
      embrace, with firm and desperate resolution, either one side or the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, if that is all,&rdquo; replied Catherine Seyton, in a tone of enthusiasm,
      &ldquo;you shall be guerdoned with prayers from oppressed subjects&mdash;from
      dispossessed clergy&mdash;from insulted nobles&mdash;with immortal praise
      by future ages&mdash;with eager gratitude by the present&mdash;with fame
      on earth, and with felicity in heaven! Your country will thank you&mdash;your
      Queen will be debtor to you&mdash;you will achieve at once the highest
      from the lowest degree in chivalry&mdash;all men will honour, all women
      will love you&mdash;and I, sworn with you so early to the accomplishment
      of Queen Mary's freedom, will&mdash;yes, I will&mdash;love you better than&mdash;ever
      sister loved brother!&rdquo; &ldquo;Say on&mdash;say on!&rdquo; whispered Roland, kneeling
      on one knee, and taking her hand, which, in the warmth of exhortation,
      Catherine held towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, pausing, &ldquo;I have already said too much&mdash;far too
      much, if I prevail not with you&mdash;far too little if I do. But I
      prevail,&rdquo; she continued, seeing that the countenance of the youth she
      addressed returned the enthusiasm of her own&mdash;&ldquo;I prevail; or rather
      the good cause prevails through its own strength&mdash;thus I devote thee
      to it.&rdquo; And as she spoke she approached her finger to the brow of the
      astonished youth, and, without touching it, signed the cross over his
      forehead&mdash;stooped her face towards him, and seemed to kiss the empty
      space in which she had traced the symbol; then starting up, and
      extricating herself from his grasp, darted into the Queen's apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme remained as the enthusiastic maiden had left him, kneeling
      on one knee, with breath withheld, and with eyes fixed upon the space
      which the fairy form of Catherine Seyton had so lately occupied. If his
      thoughts were not of unmixed delight, they at least partook of that
      thrilling and intoxicating, though mingled sense of pain and pleasure, the
      most over-powering which life offers in its blended cup. He rose and
      retired slowly; and although the chaplain Mr. Henderson preached on that
      evening his best sermon against the errors of Popery, I would not engage
      that he was followed accurately through the train of his reasoning by the
      young proselyte, with a view to whose especial benefit he had handled the
      subject.

      Chapter the Twenty-Fifth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And when love's torch hath set the heart in flame,
  Comes Seignor Reason, with his saws and cautions,
  Giving such aid as the old gray-beard Sexton,
  Who from the church-vault drags the crazy engine,
  To ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet
  Against a conflagration.
                                OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      In a musing mood, Roland Graeme upon the ensuing morning betook himself to
      the battlements of the Castle, as a spot where he might indulge the course
      of his thick-coming fancies with least chance of interruption. But his
      place of retirement was in the present case ill chosen, for he was
      presently joined by Mr. Elias Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sought you, young man,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;having to speak of
      something which concerns you nearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page had no pretence for avoiding the conference which the chaplain
      thus offered, though he felt that it might prove an embarrassing one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In teaching thee, as far as my feeble knowledge hath permitted, thy duty
      towards God,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;there are particulars of your duty
      towards man, upon which I was unwilling long or much to insist. You are
      here in the service of a lady, honourable as touching her birth, deserving
      of all compassion as respects her misfortunes, and garnished with even but
      too many of those outward qualities which win men's regard and affection.
      Have you ever considered your regard to this Lady Mary of Scotland, in its
      true light and bearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, reverend sir,&rdquo; replied Roland Graeme, &ldquo;that I am well aware of
      the duties a servant in my condition owes to his royal mistress,
      especially in her lowly and distressed condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered the preacher; &ldquo;but it is even that honest feeling which
      may, in the Lady Mary's case, carry thee into great crime and treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, reverend sir?&rdquo; replied the page; &ldquo;I profess I understand you
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak to you not of the crimes of this ill-advised lady,&rdquo; said the
      preacher; &ldquo;they are not subjects for the ears of her sworn servant. But it
      is enough to say, that this unhappy person hath rejected more offers of
      grace, and more hopes of glory, than ever were held out to earthly
      princes; and that she is now, her day of favour being passed, sequestered
      in this lonely castle, for the common weal of the people of Scotland, and
      it may be for the benefit of her own soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend sir,&rdquo; said Roland, somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;I am but too well
      aware that my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned, since I have the
      misfortune to share in her restraint myself&mdash;of which, to speak
      sooth, I am heartily weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is even of that which I am about to speak,&rdquo; said the chaplain, mildly;
      &ldquo;but, first, my good Roland, look forth on the pleasant prospect of yonder
      cultivated plain. You see, where the smoke arises, yonder village standing
      half hidden by the trees, and you know it to be the dwelling-place of
      peace and industry. From space to space, each by the side of its own
      stream, you see the gray towers of barons, with cottages interspersed; and
      you know that they also, with their household, are now living in unity;
      the lance hung upon the wall, and the sword resting in its sheath. You
      see, too, more than one fair church, where the pure waters of life are
      offered to the thirsty, and where the hungry are refreshed with spiritual
      food.&mdash;What would he deserve, who should bring fire and slaughter
      into so fair and happy a scene&mdash;who should bare the swords of the
      gentry and turn them against each other&mdash;who should give tower and
      cottage to the flames, and slake the embers with the blood of the
      indwellers?&mdash;What would he deserve who should lift up again that
      ancient Dagon of Superstition, whom the worthies of the time have beaten
      down, and who should once more make the churches of God the high places of
      Baal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have limned a frightful picture, reverend sir,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme;
      &ldquo;yet I guess not whom you would charge with the purpose of effecting a
      change so horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; replied the preacher, &ldquo;that I should say to thee, Thou art
      the man.&mdash;Yet beware, Roland Graeme, that thou, in serving thy
      mistress, hold fast the still higher service which thou owest to the peace
      of thy country, and the prosperity of her inhabitants; else, Roland
      Graeme, thou mayest be the very man upon whose head will fall the curses
      and assured punishment due to such work. If thou art won by the song of
      these sirens to aid that unhappy lady's escape from this place of
      penitence and security, it is over with the peace of Scotland's cottages,
      and with the prosperity of her palaces&mdash;and the babe unborn shall
      curse the name of the man who gave inlet to the disorder which will follow
      the war betwixt the mother and the son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no such plan, reverend sir,&rdquo; answered the page, &ldquo;and therefore
      can aid none such.&mdash;My duty towards the Queen has been simply that of
      an attendant; it is a task, of which, at times, I would willingly have
      been freed; nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to prepare thee for the enjoyment of something more of liberty,&rdquo;
       said the preacher, &ldquo;that I have endeavoured to impress upon you the deep
      responsibility under which your office must be discharged. George Douglas
      hath told the Lady Lochleven that you are weary of this service, and my
      intercession hath partly determined her good ladyship, that, as your
      discharge cannot be granted, you shall, instead, be employed in certain
      commissions on the mainland, which have hitherto been discharged by other
      persons of confidence. Wherefore, come with me to the lady, for even
      to-day such duty will be imposed on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you will hold me excused, reverend sir,&rdquo; said the page, who felt
      that an increase of confidence on the part of the Lady of the Castle and
      her family would render his situation in a moral view doubly embarrassing,
      &ldquo;one cannot serve two masters&mdash;and I much fear that my mistress will
      not hold me excused for taking employment under another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not that,&rdquo; said the preacher; &ldquo;her consent shall be asked and
      obtained. I fear she will yield it but too easily, as hoping to avail
      herself of your agency to maintain correspondence with her friends, as
      those falsely call themselves, who would make her name the watchword for
      civil war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I shall be exposed to suspicion on all sides;
      for my mistress will consider me as a spy placed on her by her enemies,
      seeing me so far trusted by them; and the Lady Lochleven will never cease
      to suspect the possibility of my betraying her, because circumstances put
      it into my power to do so&mdash;I would rather remain as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a pause of one or two minutes, during which Henderson
      looked steadily in Roland's countenance, as if desirous to ascertain
      whether there was not more in the answer than the precise words seemed to
      imply. He failed in this point, however; for Roland, bred a page from
      childhood, knew how to assume a sullen pettish cast of countenance, well
      enough calculated to hide all internal emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand thee not, Roland,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;or rather thou
      thinkest on this matter more deeply than I apprehended to be in thy
      nature. Methought, the delight of going on shore with thy bow, or thy gun,
      or thy angling-rod, would have borne away all other feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it would,&rdquo; replied Roland, who perceived the danger of suffering
      Henderson's half-raised suspicions to become fully awake,&mdash;&ldquo;I would
      have thought of nothing but the gun and the oar, and the wild water-fowl
      that tempt me by sailing among the sedges yonder so far out of
      flight-shot, had you not spoken of my going on shore as what was to
      occasion burning of town and tower, the downfall of the evangele, and the
      upsetting of the mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, then,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;and we will seek the Lady Lochleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found her at breakfast with her grandson George Douglas.&mdash;&ldquo;Peace
      be with your ladyship!&rdquo; said the preacher, bowing to his patroness;
      &ldquo;Roland Graeme awaits your order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;our chaplain hath warranted for thy fidelity,
      and we are determined to give you certain errands to do for us in our town
      of Kinross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by my advice,&rdquo; said Douglas, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said not that it was,&rdquo; answered the lady, something sharply. &ldquo;The
      mother of thy father may, I should think, be old enough to judge for
      herself in a matter so simple.&mdash;Thou wilt take the skiff, Roland, and
      two of my people, whom Dryfesdale or Randal will order out, and fetch off
      certain stuff of plate and hangings, which should last night be lodged at
      Kinross by the wains from Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give this packet,&rdquo; said George Douglas, &ldquo;to a servant of ours, whom
      you will find in waiting there.&mdash;It is the report to my father,&rdquo; he
      added, looking towards his grandmother, who acquiesced by bending her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already mentioned to Master Henderson,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;that
      as my duty requires my attendance on the Queen, her Grace's permission for
      my journey ought to be obtained before I can undertake your commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to it, my son,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;the scruple of the youth is
      honourable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craving your pardon, madam, I have no wish to force myself on her
      presence thus early,&rdquo; said. Douglas, in an indifferent tone; &ldquo;it might
      displease her, and were no way agreeable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven, &ldquo;although her temper hath been more
      gentle of late, have no will to undergo, without necessity, the rancour of
      her wit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under your permission, madam,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;I will myself render
      your request to the Queen. During my long residence in this house she hath
      not deigned to see me in private, or to hear my doctrine; yet so may
      Heaven prosper my labours, as love for her soul, and desire to bring her
      into the right path, was my chief desire for coming hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Master Henderson,&rdquo; said Douglas, in a tone which seemed almost
      sarcastic, &ldquo;lest you rush hastily on an adventure to which you have no
      vocation&mdash;you are learned, and know the adage, <i>Ne accesseris in
      consilium nisi vocatus</i>.&mdash;Who hath required this at your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Master to whose service I am called,&rdquo; answered the preacher, looking
      upward,&mdash;&ldquo;He who hath commanded me to be earnest in season and out of
      season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your acquaintance hath not been much, I think, with courts or princes,&rdquo;
       continued the young Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Henderson, &ldquo;but like my Master Knox, I see nothing
      frightful in the fair face of a pretty lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;quench not the good man's zeal&mdash;let
      him do the errand to this unhappy Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With more willingness than I would do it myself,&rdquo; said George Douglas.
      Yet something in his manner appeared to contradict his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister went accordingly, followed by Roland Graeme, and, demanding
      an audience of the imprisoned Princess, was admitted. He found her with
      her ladies engaged in the daily task of embroidery. The Queen received him
      with that courtesy, which, in ordinary cases, she used towards all who
      approached her, and the clergyman, in opening his commission, was
      obviously somewhat more embarrassed than he had expected to be.&mdash;&ldquo;The
      good Lady of Lochleven&mdash;may it please your Grace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a short pause, during which Mary said, with a smile, &ldquo;My Grace
      would, in truth, be well pleased, were the Lady Lochleven our <i>good</i>
      lady&mdash;But go on&mdash;what is the will of the good Lady of
      Lochleven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She desires, madam,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;that your Grace will permit this
      young gentleman, your page, Roland Graeme, to pass to Kinross, to look
      after some household stuff and hangings, sent hither for the better
      furnishing your Grace's apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady of Lochleven,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;uses needless ceremony, in
      requesting our permission for that which stands within her own pleasure.
      We well know that this young gentleman's attendance on us had not been so
      long permitted, were he not thought to be more at the command of that good
      lady than at ours.&mdash;But we cheerfully yield consent that he shall go
      on her errand&mdash;with our will we would doom no living creature to the
      captivity which we ourselves must suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; answered the preacher, &ldquo;and it is doubtless natural for
      humanity to quarrel with its prison-house. Yet there have been those, who
      have found, that time spent in the house of temporal captivity may be so
      employed as to redeem us from spiritual slavery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apprehend your meaning, sir,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;but I have heard your
      apostle&mdash;I have heard Master John Knox; and were I to be perverted, I
      would willingly resign to the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs, the
      poor honour he might acquire by overcoming my faith and my hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;it is not to the talents or skill of the
      husbandman that God gives the increase&mdash;the words which were offered
      in vain by him whom you justly call our apostle, during the bustle and
      gaiety of a court, may yet find better acceptance during the leisure for
      reflection which this place affords. God knows, lady, that I speak in
      singleness of heart, as one who would as soon compare himself to the
      immortal angels, as to the holy man whom you have named. Yet would you but
      condescend to apply to their noblest use, those talents and that learning
      which all allow you to be possessed of&mdash;would you afford us but the
      slightest hope that you would hear and regard what can be urged against
      the blinded superstition and idolatry in which you are brought up, sure am
      I, that the most powerfully-gifted of my brethren, that even John Knox
      himself, would hasten hither, and account the rescue of your single soul
      from the nets of Romish error&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you and to them for their charity,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but as I
      have at present but one presence-chamber, I would reluctantly see it
      converted into a Huguenot synod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, madam, be not thus obstinately blinded in your errors! Hear one
      who has hungered and thirsted, watched and prayed, to undertake the good
      work of your conversion, and who would be content to die the instant that
      a work so advantageous for yourself and so beneficial to Scotland were
      accomplished&mdash;Yes, lady, could I but shake the remaining pillar of
      the heathen temple in this land&mdash;and that permit me to term your
      faith in the delusions of Rome&mdash;I could be content to die overwhelmed
      in the ruins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not insult your zeal, sir,&rdquo; replied Mary, &ldquo;by saying you are more
      likely to make sport for the Philistines than to overwhelm them&mdash;your
      charity claims my thanks, for it is warmly expressed and may be truly
      purposed&mdash;But believe as well of me as I am willing to do of you, and
      think that I may be as anxious to recall you to the ancient and only road,
      as you are to teach me your new by-ways to paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madam, if such be your generous purpose,&rdquo; said Henderson, eagerly,
      &ldquo;&mdash;what hinders that we should dedicate some part of that time,
      unhappily now too much at your Grace's disposal, to discuss a question so
      weighty? You, by report of all men, are both learned and witty; and I,
      though without such advantages, am strong in my cause as in a tower of
      defence. Why should we not spend some space in endeavouring to discover
      which of us hath the wrong side in this important matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, &ldquo;I never alleged my force was strong enough to
      accept of a combat <i>en champ clos</i>, with a scholar and a polemic.
      Besides, the match is not equal. You, sir, might retire when you felt the
      battle go against you, while I am tied to the stake, and have no
      permission to say the debate wearies me.&mdash;I would be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She curtsied low to him as she uttered these words; and Henderson, whose
      zeal was indeed ardent, but did not extend to the neglect of delicacy,
      bowed in return, and prepared to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my earnest wish, my most zealous prayer, could
      procure to your Grace any blessing or comfort, but especially that in
      which alone blessing or comfort is, as easily as the slightest intimation
      of your wish will remove me from your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in the act of departing, when Mary said to him with much courtesy,
      &ldquo;Do me no injury in your thoughts, good sir; it may be, that if my time
      here be protracted longer&mdash;as surely I hope it will not, trusting
      that either my rebel subjects will repent of their disloyalty, or that my
      faithful lieges will obtain the upper hand&mdash;but if my time be here
      protracted, it may be I shall have no displeasure in hearing one who seems
      so reasonable and compassionate as yourself, and I may hazard your
      contempt by endeavouring to recollect and repeat the reasons which
      schoolmen and councils give for the faith that is in me,&mdash;although I
      fear that, God help me! my Latin has deserted me with my other
      possessions. This must, however, be for another day. Meanwhile, sir, let
      the Lady of Lochleven employ my page as she lists&mdash;I will not afford
      suspicion by speaking a word to him before he goes.&mdash;Roland Graeme,
      my friend, lose not an opportunity of amusing thyself&mdash;dance, sing,
      run, and leap&mdash;all may be done merrily on the mainland; but he must
      have more than quicksilver in his veins who would frolic here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;to what is it you exhort the youth,
      while time passes, and eternity summons? Can our salvation be insured by
      idle mirth, or our good work wrought out without fear and trembling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot fear or tremble,&rdquo; replied the Queen; &ldquo;to Mary Stewart such
      emotions are unknown. But if weeping and sorrow on my part will atone for
      the boy's enjoying an hour of boyish pleasure, be assured the penance
      shall be duly paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, gracious lady,&rdquo; said the preacher, &ldquo;in this you greatly err;&mdash;our
      tears and our sorrows are all too little for our own faults and follies,
      nor can we transfer them, as your church falsely teaches, to the benefit
      of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I pray you, sir,&rdquo; answered the Queen, &ldquo;with as little offence as such
      a prayer may import, to transfer yourself elsewhere? We are sick at heart,
      and may not now be disposed with farther controversy&mdash;and thou,
      Roland, take this little purse;&rdquo; (then, turning to the divine, she said,
      showing its contents,) &ldquo;Look, reverend sir,&mdash;it contains only these
      two or three gold testoons, a coin which, though bearing my own poor
      features, I have ever found more active against me than on my side, just
      as my subjects take arms against me, with my own name for their summons
      and signal.&mdash;Take this purse, that thou mayest want no means of
      amusement. Fail not&mdash;fail not to bring met back news from Kinross;
      only let it be such as, without suspicion or offence, may be told in the
      presence of this reverend gentleman, or of the good Lady Lochleven
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last hint was too irresistible to be withstood; and Henderson
      withdrew, half mortified, half pleased, with his reception; for Mary, from
      long habit, and the address which was natural to her, had learned, in an
      extraordinary degree, the art of evading discourse which was disagreeable
      to her feelings or prejudices, without affronting those by whom it was
      proffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme retired with the chaplain, at a signal from his lady; but it
      did not escape him, that as he left the room, stepping backwards, and
      making the deep obeisance due to royalty, Catherine Seyton held up her
      slender forefinger, with a gesture which he alone could witness, and which
      seemed to say, &ldquo;Remember what has passed betwixt us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young page had now his last charge from the Lady of Lochleven. &ldquo;There
      are revels,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this day at the village&mdash;my son's authority
      is, as yet, unable to prevent these continued workings of the ancient
      leaven of folly which the Romish priests have kneaded into the very souls
      of the Scottish peasantry. I do not command thee to abstain from them&mdash;that
      would be only to lay a snare for thy folly, or to teach thee falsehood;
      but enjoy these vanities with moderation, and mark them as something thou
      must soon learn to renounce and contemn. Our chamberlain at Kinross, Luke
      Lundin,&mdash;Doctor, as he foolishly calleth himself,&mdash;will acquaint
      thee what is to be done in the matter about which thou goest. Remember
      thou art trusted&mdash;show thyself, therefore, worthy of trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we recollect that Roland Graeme was not yet nineteen, and that he had
      spent his whole life in the solitary Castle of Avenel, excepting the few
      hours he had passed in Edinburgh, and his late residence at Lochleven,
      (the latter period having very little served to enlarge his acquaintance
      with the gay world.) we cannot wonder that his heart beat, high with hope
      and curiosity, at the prospect of partaking the sport even of a country
      wake. He hastened to his little cabin, and turned over the wardrobe with
      which (in every respect becoming his station) he had been supplied from
      Edinburgh, probably by order of the Earl of Murray. By the Queen's command
      he had hitherto waited upon her in mourning, or at least in sad-coloured
      raiment. Her condition, she said, admitted of nothing more gay. But now he
      selected the gayest dress his wardrobe afforded; composed of scarlet
      slashed with black satin, the royal colours of Scotland&mdash;combed his
      long curled hair&mdash;disposed his chain and medal round a beaver hat of
      the newest block; and with the gay falchion which had reached him in so
      mysterious a manner, hung by his side in an embroidered belt, his apparel,
      added to his natural frank mien and handsome figure, formed a most
      commendable and pleasing specimen of the young gallant of the period. He
      sought to make his parting reverence to the Queen and her ladies, but old
      Dryfesdale hurried him to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have no private audiences,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my master; since you are to
      be trusted with somewhat, we will try at least to save thee from the
      temptation of opportunity. God help thee, child,&rdquo; he added, with a glance
      of contempt at his gay clothes, &ldquo;an the bear-ward be yonder from Saint
      Andrews, have a care thou go not near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore, I pray you?&rdquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lest he take thee for one of his runaway jackanapes,&rdquo; answered the
      steward, smiling sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wear not my clothes at thy cost,&rdquo; said Roland indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor at thine own either, my son&rdquo; replied the steward, &ldquo;else would thy
      garb more nearly resemble thy merit and thy station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme suppressed with difficulty the repartee which arose to his
      lips, and, wrapping his scarlet mantle around him, threw himself into the
      boat, which two rowers, themselves urged by curiosity to see the revels,
      pulled stoutly towards the west end of the lake. As they put off, Roland
      thought he could discover the face of Catherine Seyton, though carefully
      withdrawn from observation, peeping from a loophole to view his departure.
      He pulled off his hat, and held it up as a token that he saw and wished
      her adieu. A white kerchief waved for a second across the window, and for
      the rest of the little voyage, the thoughts of Catherine Seyton disputed
      ground in his breast with the expectations excited by the approaching
      revel. As they drew nearer and nearer the shore, the sounds of mirth and
      music, the laugh, the halloo, and the shout, came thicker upon the ear,
      and in a trice the boat was moored, and Roland Graeme hastened in quest of
      the chamberlain, that, being informed what time he had at his own
      disposal, he might lay it out to the best advantage.

    <p>
      No long space intervened ere Roland Graeme was able to discover among the
      crowd of revellers, who gambolled upon the open space which extends
      betwixt the village and the lake, a person of so great importance as Dr.
      Luke Lundin, upon whom devolved officially the charge of representing the
      lord of the land, and who was attended for support of his authority by a
      piper, a drummer, and four sturdy clowns armed with rusty halberds,
      garnished with party-coloured ribbons; myrmidons who, early as the day
      was, had already broken more than one head in the awful names of the Laird
      of Lochleven and his chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: At Scottish fairs, the bailie, or magistrate, deputed by the
      lord in whose name the meeting is held, attends the fair with his guard,
      decides trifling disputes, and punishes on the spot any petty
      delinquencies. His attendants are usually armed with halberds, and
      sometimes, at least, escorted by music. Thus, in the &ldquo;Life and Death of
      Habbie Simpson,&rdquo; we are told of that famous minstrel,&mdash;
    </p>

   &ldquo;At fairs he play'd before the spear-men,
   And gaily graithed in their gear-men;&mdash;
   Steel bonnets, jacks, and swords shone clear then,

   Now wha shall play before sic weir-men,

</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as this dignitary was informed that the castle skiff had arrived,
      with a gallant, dressed like a lord's son at the least, who desired
      presently to speak to him, he adjusted his ruff and his black coat, turned
      round his girdle till the garnished hilt of his long rapier became
      visible, and walked with due solemnity towards the beach. Solemn indeed he
      was entitled to be, even on less important occasions, for he had been bred
      to the venerable study of medicine, as those acquainted with the science
      very soon discovered from the aphorisms which ornamented his discourse.
      His success had not been equal to his pretensions; but as he was a native
      of the neighbouring kingdom of Fife, and bore distant relation to, or
      dependence upon, the ancient family of Lundin of that Ilk, who were bound
      in close friendship with the house of Lochleven, he had, through their
      interest, got planted comfortably enough in his present station upon the
      banks of that beautiful lake. The profits of his chamberlainship being
      moderate, especially in those unsettled times, he had eked it out a little
      with some practice in his original profession; and it was said that the
      inhabitants of the village and barony of Kinross were not more effectually
      thirled (which may be translated enthralled) to the baron's mill, than
      they were to the medical monopoly of the chamberlain. Wo betide the family
      of the rich boor, who presumed to depart this life without a passport from
      Dr. Luke Lundin! for if his representatives had aught to settle with the
      baron, as it seldom happened otherwise, they were sure to find a cold
      friend in the chamberlain. He was considerate enough, however,
      gratuitously to help the poor out of their ailments, and sometimes out of
      all their other distresses at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal, in a double proportion, both as a physician and as a person in
      office, and proud of the scraps of learning which rendered his language
      almost universally unintelligible, Dr. Luke Lundin approached the beach,
      and hailed the page as he advanced towards him.&mdash;&ldquo;The freshness of
      the morning upon you, fair sir&mdash;You are sent, I warrant me, to see if
      we observe here the regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed, for
      eschewing all superstitious observances and idle anilities in these our
      revels. I am aware that her good ladyship would willingly have altogether
      abolished and abrogated them&mdash;But as I had the honour to quote to her
      from the works of the learned Hercules of Saxony, <i>omnis curatio est vel
      canonica vel coacta</i>,&mdash;that is, fair sir, (for silk and velvet
      have seldom their Latin <i>ad unguem</i>,) every cure must be wrought
      either by art and induction of rule, or by constraint; and the wise
      physician chooseth the former. Which argument her ladyship being pleased
      to allow well of, I have made it my business so to blend instruction and
      caution with delight&mdash;<i>fiat mixtio</i>, as we say&mdash;that I can
      answer that the vulgar mind will be defecated and purged of anile and
      Popish fooleries by the medicament adhibited, so that the <i>primae vice</i>
      being cleansed, Master Henderson, or any other able pastor, may at will
      throw in tonics, and effectuate a perfect moral cure, <i>tuto, cito,
      jucunde</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no charge, Dr. Lundin,&rdquo; replied the page&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me not doctor,&rdquo; said the chamberlain, &ldquo;since I have laid aside my
      furred gown and bonnet, and retired me into this temporality of
      chamberlainship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said the page, who was no stranger by report to the character
      of this original, &ldquo;the cowl makes not the monk, neither the cord the friar&mdash;we
      have all heard of the cures wrought by Dr. Lundin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toys, young sir&mdash;trifles,&rdquo; answered the leech with grave
      disclamation of superior skill; &ldquo;the hit-or-miss practice of a poor
      retired gentleman, in a short cloak and doublet&mdash;Marry, Heaven sent
      its blessing&mdash;and this I must say, better fashioned mediciners have
      brought fewer patients through&mdash;<i>lunga roba corta scienzia</i>,
      saith the Italian&mdash;ha, fair sir, you have the language?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme did not think it necessary to expound to this learned Theban
      whether he understood him or no; but, leaving that matter uncertain, he
      told him he came in quest of certain packages which should have arrived at
      Kinross, and been placed under the chamberlain's charge the evening
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Body o' me!&rdquo; said Doctor Lundin, &ldquo;I fear our common carrier, John
      Auchtermuchty, hath met with some mischance, that he came not up last
      night with his wains&mdash;bad land this to journey in, my master; and the
      fool will travel by night too, although, (besides all maladies from your
      <i>tussis</i> to your <i>pestis</i>, which walk abroad in the night-air,)
      he may well fall in with half a dozen swash-bucklers, who will ease him at
      once of his baggage and his earthly complaints. I must send forth to
      inquire after him, since he hath stuff of the honourable household on hand&mdash;and,
      by our Lady, he hath stuff of mine too&mdash;certain drugs sent me from
      the city for composition of my alexipharmics&mdash;this gear must be
      looked to.&mdash;Hodge,&rdquo; said he, addressing one of his redoubted
      body-guard, &ldquo;do thou and Toby Telford take the mickle brown aver and the
      black cut-tailed mare, and make out towards the Kerry-craigs, and see what
      tidings you can have of Auchtermuchty and his wains&mdash;I trust it is
      only the medicine of the pottle-pot, (being the only <i>medicamentum</i>
      which the beast useth,) which hath caused him to tarry on the road. Take
      the ribbons from your halberds, ye knaves, and get on your jacks,
      plate-sleeves, and knapskulls, that your presence may work some terror if
      you meet with opposers.&rdquo; He then added, turning to Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I
      warrant me, we shall have news of the wains in brief season. Meantime it
      will please you to look upon the sports; but first to enter my poor
      lodging and take your morning's cup. For what saith the school of Salerno?

    <p>
      &ldquo;Your learning is too profound for me,&rdquo; replied the page; &ldquo;and so would
      your draught be likewise, I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit, fair sir&mdash;a cordial cup of sack, impregnated with
      wormwood, is the best anti-pestilential draught; and, to speak truth, the
      pestilential miasmata are now very rife in the atmosphere. We live in a
      happy time, young man,&rdquo; continued he, in a tone of grave irony, &ldquo;and have
      many blessings unknown to our fathers&mdash;Here are two sovereigns in the
      land, a regnant and a claimant&mdash;that is enough of one good thing&mdash;but
      if any one wants more, he may find a king in every peel-house in the
      country; so if we lack government, it is not for want of governors. Then
      have we a civil war to phlebotomize us every year, and to prevent our
      population from starving for want of food&mdash;and for the same purpose
      we have the Plague proposing us a visit, the best of all recipes for
      thinning a land, and converting younger brothers into elder ones. Well,
      each man in his vocation. You young fellows of the sword desire to
      wrestle, fence, or so forth, with some expert adversary; and for my part,
      I love to match myself for life or death against that same Plague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded up the street of the little village towards the Doctor's
      lodgings, his attention was successively occupied by the various
      personages whom he met, and pointed out to the notice of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that fellow with the red bonnet, the blue jerkin, and the
      great rough baton in his hand?&mdash;I believe that clown hath the
      strength of a tower&mdash;he has lived fifty years in the world, and never
      encouraged the liberal sciences by buying one penny-worth of medicaments.&mdash;But
      see you that man with the <i>facies hippocratica</i>?&rdquo; said he, pointing
      out a thin peasant, with swelled legs, and a most cadaverous countenance;
      &ldquo;that I call one of the worthiest men in the barony&mdash;he breakfasts,
      luncheons, dines, and sups by my advice, and not without my medicine; and,
      for his own single part, will go farther to clear out a moderate stock of
      pharmaceutics, than half the country besides.&mdash;How do you, my honest
      friend?&rdquo; said he to the party in question, with a tone of condolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very weakly, sir, since I took the electuary,&rdquo; answered the patient; &ldquo;it
      neighboured ill with the two spoonfuls of pease-porridge and the
      kirnmilk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pease-porridge and kirnmilk! Have you been under medicine these ten
      years, and keep your diet so ill?&mdash;the next morning take the
      electuary by itself, and touch nothing for six hours.&rdquo;&mdash;The poor
      object bowed, and limped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next whom the Doctor deigned to take notice of, was a lame fellow, by
      whom the honour was altogether undeserved, for at sight of the mediciner,
      he began to shuffle away in the crowd as fast as his infirmities would
      permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an ungrateful hound for you,&rdquo; said Doctor Lundin; &ldquo;I cured him
      of the gout in his feet, and now he talks of the chargeableness of
      medicine, and makes the first use of his restored legs to fly from his
      physician. His <i>podagra</i> hath become a <i>chiragra</i>, as honest
      Martial hath it&mdash;the gout has got into his fingers, and he cannot
      draw his purse. Old saying and true,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Praemia cum poscit medicus, Sathan est.
</pre>
    <p>
      We are angels when we come to cure&mdash;devils when we ask payment&mdash;but
      I will administer a purgation to his purse I warrant him. There is his
      brother too, a sordid chuff.&mdash;So ho, there! Saunders Darlet! you have
      been ill, I hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just got the turn, as I was thinking to send to your honour, and I am
      brawly now again&mdash;it was nae great thing that ailed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark you, sirrah,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I trust you remember you are owing
      to the laird four stones of barleymeal, and a bow of oats; and I would
      have you send no more such kain-fowls as you sent last season, that looked
      as wretchedly as patients just dismissed from a plague-hospital; and there
      is hard money owing besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking, sir,&rdquo; said the man, <i>more Scotico</i>, that is,
      returning no direct answer on the subject on which he was addressed, &ldquo;my
      best way would be to come down to your honour, and take your advice yet,
      in case my trouble should come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, then, knave,&rdquo; replied Lundin, &ldquo;and remember what Ecclesiasticus
      saith&mdash;'Give place to the physician-let him not go from thee, for
      thou hast need of him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His exhortation was interrupted by an apparition, which seemed to strike
      the doctor with as much horror and surprise, as his own visage inflicted
      upon sundry of those persons whom he had addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure which produced this effect on the Esculapius of the village,
      was that of a tall old woman, who wore a high-crowned hat and muffler. The
      first of these habiliments added apparently to her stature, and the other
      served to conceal the lower part of her face, and as the hat itself was
      slouched, little could be seen besides two brown cheek-bones, and the eyes
      of swarthy fire, that gleamed from under two shaggy gray eyebrows. She was
      dressed in a long dark-coloured robe of unusual fashion, bordered at the
      skirts, and on the stomacher, with a sort of white trimming resembling the
      Jewish phylacteries, on which were wrought the characters of some unknown
      language. She held in her hand a walking staff of black ebony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the soul of Celsus,&rdquo; said Doctor Luke Lundin, &ldquo;it is old Mother
      Nicneven herself&mdash;she hath come to beard me within mine own bounds,
      and in the very execution of mine office! Have at thy coat, Old Woman, as
      the song says&mdash;Hob Anster, let her presently be seized and committed
      to the tolbooth; and if there are any zealous brethren here who would give
      the hag her deserts, and duck her, as a witch, in the loch, I pray let
      them in no way be hindered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the myrmidons of Dr. Lundin showed in this case no alacrity to do his
      bidding. Hob Anster even ventured to remonstrate in the name of himself
      and his brethren. &ldquo;To be sure he was to do his honour's bidding; and for
      a' that folks said about the skill and witcheries of Mother Nicneven, he
      would put his trust in God, and his hand on her collar, without dreadour.
      But she was no common spaewife, this Mother Nicneven, like Jean Jopp that
      lived in the Bricrie-baulk. She had lords and lairds that would ruffle for
      her. There was Moncrieff of Tippermalloch, that was Popish, and the laird
      of Carslogie, a kend Queen's man, were in the fair, with wha kend how mony
      swords and bucklers at their back; and they would be sure to make a
      break-out if the officers meddled with the auld Popish witch-wife, who was
      sae weel friended; mair especially as the laird's best men, such as were
      not in the castle, were in Edinburgh with him, and he doubted his honour
      the Doctor would find ower few to make a good backing, if blades were
      bare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor listened unwillingly to this prudential counsel, and was only
      comforted by the faithful promise of his satellite, that &ldquo;the old woman
      should,&rdquo; as he expressed it, &ldquo;be ta'en canny the next time she trespassed
      on the bounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that event,&rdquo; said the Doctor to his companion, &ldquo;fire and fagot
      shall be the best of her welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he spoke in hearing of the dame herself, who even then, and in
      passing the Doctor, shot towards him from under her gray eyebrows a look
      of the most insulting and contemptuous superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; continued the physician, &ldquo;this way,&rdquo; marshalling his guest
      into his lodging,&mdash;&ldquo;take care you stumble not over a retort, for it
      is hazardous for the ignorant to walk in the ways of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page found all reason for the caution; for besides stuffed birds, and
      lizards, and snakes bottled up, and bundles of simples made up, and other
      parcels spread out to dry, and all the confusion, not to mention the
      mingled and sickening smells, incidental to a druggist's stock in trade,
      he had also to avoid heaps of charcoal crucibles, bolt-heads, stoves, and
      the other furniture of a chemical laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst his other philosophical qualities, Doctor Lundin failed not to be
      a confused sloven, and his old dame housekeeper, whose life, as she said,
      was spent in &ldquo;redding him up,&rdquo; had trotted off to the mart of gaiety with
      other and younger folks. Much chattering and jangling therefore there was
      among jars, and bottles, and vials, ere the Doctor produced the
      salutiferous potion which he recommended so strongly, and a search equally
      long and noisy followed, among broken cans and cracked pipkins, ere he
      could bring forth a cup out of which to drink it. Both matters being at
      length achieved, the Doctor set the example to his guest, by quaffing off
      a cup of the cordial, and smacking his lips with approbation as it
      descended his gullet.&mdash;Roland, in turn, submitted to swallow the
      potion which his host so earnestly recommended, but which he found so
      insufferably bitter, that he became eager to escape from the laboratory in
      search of a draught of fair water to expel the taste. In spite of his
      efforts, he was nevertheless detained by the garrulity of his host, till
      he gave him some account of Mother Nicneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not to speak of her,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;in the open air, and among
      the throng of people; not for fright, like yon cowardly dog Anster, but
      because I would give no occasion for a fray, having no leisure to look to
      stabs, slashes, and broken bones. Men call the old hag a prophetess&mdash;I
      do scarce believe she could foretell when a brood of chickens will chip
      the shell&mdash;Men say she reads the heavens&mdash;my black bitch knows
      as much of them when she sits baying the moon&mdash;Men pretend the
      ancient wretch is a sorceress, a witch, and, what not&mdash;<i>Inter nos</i>,
      I will never contradict a rumour which may bring her to the stake which
      she so justly deserves; but neither will I believe that the tales of
      witches which they din into our ears are aught but knavery, cozenage, and
      old women's fables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, what is she then,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;that you make
      such a stir about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is one of those cursed old women,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;who take
      currently and impudently upon themselves to act as advisers and curers of
      the sick, on the strength of some trash of herbs, some rhyme of spells,
      some julap or diet, drink or cordial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, go no farther,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;if they brew cordials, evil be their
      lot and all their partakers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say well, young man,&rdquo; said Dr. Lundin; &ldquo;for mine own part, I know no
      such pests to the commonwealth as these old incarnate devils, who haunt
      the chambers of the brain-sick patients, that are mad enough to suffer
      them to interfere with, disturb, and let, the regular process of a learned
      and artificial cure, with their sirups, and their julaps, and diascordium,
      and mithridate, and my Lady What-shall-call'um's powder, and worthy Dame
      Trashem's pill; and thus make widows and orphans, and cheat the regular
      and well-studied physician, in order to get the name of wise women and
      skeely neighbours, and so forth. But no more on't&mdash;Mother Nicneven
      [Footnote: This was the name given to the grand Mother Witch, the very
      Hecate of Scottish popular superstition. Her name was bestowed, in one or
      two instances, upon sorceresses, who were held to resemble her by their
      superior skill in &ldquo;Hell's black grammar.&rdquo;] and I will meet one day, and
      she shall know there is danger in dealing with the Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a true word, and many have found it,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;but under
      your favour, I would fain walk abroad for a little, and see these sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well moved,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;and I too should be showing myself
      abroad. Moreover the play waits us, young man-to-day, <i>totus mundus agit
      histrionem</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;And they sallied forth accordingly into the
      mirthful scene.

    <h2>
      Chapter the Twenty-Seventh.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  See on yon verdant lawn, the gathering crowd
  Thickens amain; the buxom nymphs advance,
  Usher'd by jolly clowns; distinctions cease,
  Lost in the common joy, and the bold slave
  Leans on his wealthy master unreproved.
              <i>Rural Games</i>.&mdash;SOMERVILLLE.
</pre>
    <p>
      The re-appearance of the dignified Chamberlain on the street of the
      village was eagerly hailed by the revellers, as a pledge that the play, or
      dramatic representation, which had been postponed owing to his absence,
      was now full surely to commence. Any thing like an approach to this most
      interesting of all amusements, was of recent origin in Scotland, and
      engaged public attention in proportion. All other sports were
      discontinued. The dance around the Maypole was arrested&mdash;the ring
      broken up and dispersed, while the dancers, each leading his partner by
      the hand, tripped, off to the silvan theatre. A truce was in like manner
      achieved betwixt a huge brown bear and certain mastiffs, who were tugging
      and pulling at his shaggy coat, under the mediation of the bear-ward and
      half a dozen butchers and yeomen, who, by dint of <i>staving and tailing</i>,
      as it was technically termed, separated the unfortunate animals, whose
      fury had for an hour past been their chief amusement. The itinerant
      minstrel found himself deserted by the audience he had collected, even in
      the most interesting passage of the romance which he recited, and just as
      he was sending about his boy, with bonnet in hand, to collect their
      oblations. He indignantly stopped short in the midst of <i>Rosewal and
      Lilian</i>, and, replacing his three-stringed fiddle, or rebeck, in its
      leathern case, followed the crowd, with no good-will, to the exhibition
      which had superseded his own. The juggler had ceased his exertions of
      emitting flame and smoke, and was content to respire in the manner of
      ordinary mortals, rather than to play gratuitously the part of a fiery
      dragon. In short, all other sports were suspended, so eagerly did the
      revellers throng towards the place of representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would err greatly, who should regulate their ideas of this dramatic
      exhibition upon those derived from a modern theatre; for the rude shows of
      Thespis were far less different from those exhibited by Euripides on the
      stage of Athens, with all its magnificent decorations and pomp of dresses
      and of scenery. In the present case, there were no scenes, no stage, no
      machinery, no pit, box, and gallery, no box-lobby; and, what might in poor
      Scotland be some consolation for other negations, there was no taking of
      money at the door. As in the devices of the magnanimous Bottom, the actors
      had a greensward plot for a stage, and a hawthorn bush for a greenroom and
      tiring-house; the spectators being accommodated with seats on the
      artificial bank which had been raised around three-fourths of the
      playground, the remainder being left open for the entrance and exit of the
      performers. Here sate the uncritical audience, the Chamberlain in the
      centre, as the person highest in office, all alive to enjoyment and
      admiration, and all therefore dead to criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters which appeared and disappeared before the amused and
      interested audience, were those which fill the earlier stage in all
      nations&mdash;old men, cheated by their wives and daughters, pillaged by
      their sons, and imposed on by their domestics, a braggadocia captain, a
      knavish pardoner or quaestionary, a country bumpkin and a wanton city
      dame. Amid all these, and more acceptable than almost the whole put
      together, was the all-licensed fool, the Gracioso of the Spanish drama,
      who, with his cap fashioned into the resemblance of a coxcomb, and his
      bauble, a truncheon terminated by a carved figure wearing a fool's cap, in
      his hand, went, came, and returned, mingling in every scene of the piece,
      and interrupting the business, without having any share himself in the
      action, and ever and anon transferring his gibes from the actors on the
      stage to the audience who sate around, prompt to applaud the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wit of the piece, which was not of the most polished kind, was chiefly
      directed against the superstitious practices of the Catholic religion; and
      the stage artillery had on this occasion been levelled by no less a person
      than Doctor Lundin, who had not only commanded the manager of the
      entertainment to select one of the numerous satires which had been written
      against the Papists, (several of which were cast in a dramatic form,) but
      had even, like the Prince of Denmark, caused them to insert, or according
      to his own phrase, to infuse here and there, a few pleasantries of his own
      penning, on the same inexhaustible subject, hoping thereby to mollify the
      rigour of the Lady of Lochleven towards pastimes of this description. He
      failed not to jog Roland's elbow, who was sitting in state behind him, and
      recommend to his particular attention those favourite passages. As for the
      page, to whom, the very idea of such an exhibition, simple as it was, was
      entirely new, he beheld it with the undiminished and ecstatic delight with
      which men of all ranks look for the first time on dramatic representation,
      and laughed, shouted, and clapped his hands as the performance proceeded.
      An incident at length took place, which effectually broke off his interest
      in the business of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the principal personages in the comic part of the drama was, as we
      have already said, a quaestionary or pardoner, one of those itinerants who
      hawked about from place to place relics, real or pretended, with which he
      excited the devotion at once, and the charity of the populace, and
      generally deceived both the one and the other. The hypocrisy, impudence,
      and profligacy of these clerical wanderers, had made them the subject of
      satire from the time of Chaucer down to that of Heywood. Their present
      representative failed not to follow the same line of humour, exhibiting
      pig's bones for relics, and boasting the virtues of small tin crosses,
      which had been shaken in the holy porringer at Loretto, and of
      cockleshells, which had been brought from the shrine of Saint James of
      Compostella, all which he disposed of to the devout Catholics at nearly as
      high a price as antiquaries are now willing to pay for baubles of similar
      intrinsic value. At length the pardoner pulled from his scrip a small
      phial of clear water, of which he vaunted the quality in the following
      verses:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Listneth, gode people, everiche one
  For in the londe of Babylone,
  Far eastward I wot it lyeth,
  And is the first londe the sonne espieth,
  Ther, as he cometh fro out the sé;
  In this ilk londe, as thinketh me,
  Right as holie legendes tell.
  Snottreth from a roke a well,
  And falleth into ane bath of ston,
  Where chaste Susanne, in times long gon,

  Wax wont to wash her bodie and lim
  Mickle vertue hath that streme,
  As ye shall se er that ye pas,
  Ensample by this little glas&mdash;
  Through nightés cold and dayés hote
  Hiderward I have it brought;
  Hath a wife made slip or side,
  Or a maiden stepp'd aside,
  Putteth this water under her nese,
  Wold she nold she, she shall snese.
</pre>
    <p>
      The jest, as the reader skilful in the antique language of the drama must
      at once perceive, turned on the same pivot as in the old minstrel tales of
      the Drinking Horn of King Arthur, and the Mantle made Amiss. But the
      audience were neither learned nor critical enough to challenge its want of
      originality. The potent relic was, after such grimace and buffoonery as
      befitted the subject, presented successively to each of the female
      personages of the drama, not one of whom sustained the supposed test of
      discretion; but, to the infinite delight of the audience, sneezed much
      louder and longer than perhaps they themselves had counted on. The jest
      seemed at last worn threadbare, and the pardoner was passing on to some
      new pleasantry, when the jester or clown of the drama, possessing himself
      secretly of the phial which contained the wondrous liquor, applied it
      suddenly to the nose of a young woman, who, with her black silk muffler,
      or screen drawn over her face, was sitting in the foremost rank of the
      spectators, intent apparently upon the business of the stage. The contents
      of the phial, well calculated to sustain the credit of the pardoner's
      legend, set the damsel a-sneezing violently, an admission of frailty which
      was received with shouts of rapture by the audience. These were soon,
      however, renewed at the expense of the jester himself, when the insulted
      maiden extricated, ere the paroxysm was well over, one hand from the folds
      of her mantle, and bestowed on the wag a buffet, which made him reel fully
      his own length from the pardoner, and then acknowledge the favour by
      instant prostration.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one pities a jester overcome in his vocation, and the clown met with
      little sympathy, when, rising from the ground, and whimpering forth his
      complaints of harsh treatment, he invoked the assistance and sympathy of
      the audience. But the Chamberlain, feeling his own dignity insulted,
      ordered two of his halberdiers to bring the culprit before him. When these
      official persons first approached the virago, she threw herself into an
      attitude of firm defiance, as if determined to resist their authority; and
      from the sample of strength and spirit which she had already displayed,
      they showed no alacrity at executing their commission. But on half a
      minute's reflection, the damsel changed totally her attitude and manner,
      folded her cloak around her arms in modest and maiden-like fashion, and
      walked of her own accord to the presence of the great man, followed and
      guarded by the two manful satellites. As she moved across the vacant
      space, and more especially as she stood at the footstool of the Doctor's
      judgment-seat, the maiden discovered that lightness and elasticity of
      step, and natural grace of manner, which connoisseurs in female beauty
      know to be seldom divided from it. Moreover, her neat russet-coloured
      jacket, and short petticoat of the same colour, displayed a handsome form
      and a pretty leg. Her features were concealed by the screen; but the
      Doctor, whose gravity did not prevent his pretensions to be a connoisseur
      of the school we have hinted at, saw enough to judge favourably of the
      piece by the sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began, however, with considerable austerity of manner.&mdash;&ldquo;And how
      now, saucy quean!&rdquo; said the medical man of office; &ldquo;what have you to say
      why I should not order you to be ducked in the loch, for lifting your hand
      to the man in my presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry,&rdquo; replied the culprit, &ldquo;because I judge that your honour will not
      think the cold bath necessary for my complaints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pestilent jade,&rdquo; said the Doctor, whispering to Roland Graeme; &ldquo;and
      I'll warrant her a good one&mdash;her voice is as sweet as sirup.&mdash;But,
      my pretty maiden,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you show us wonderful little of that
      countenance of yours&mdash;be pleased to throw aside your muffler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust your honour will excuse me till we are more private,&rdquo; answered
      the maiden; &ldquo;for I have acquaintance, and I should like ill to be known in
      the country as the poor girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing for thy good name, my sweet little modicum of candied
      manna,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;for I protest to you, as I am Chamberlain of
      Lochleven, Kinross, and so forth, that the chaste Susanna herself could
      not have snuffed that elixir without sternutation, being in truth a
      curious distillation of rectified <i>acetum</i>, or vinegar of the sun,
      prepared by mine own hands&mdash;Wherefore, as thou sayest thou wilt come
      to me in private, and express thy contrition for the offence whereof thou
      hast been guilty, I command that all for the present go forward as if no
      such interruption of the prescribed course had taken place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel curtsied and tripped back to her place. The play proceeded, but
      it no longer attracted the attention of Roland Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice, the figure, and what the veil permitted to be seen of the neck
      and tresses of the village damsel, bore so strong a resemblance to those
      of Catherine Seyton, that he felt like one bewildered in the mazes of a
      changeful and stupifying dream. The memorable scene of the hostelrie
      rushed on his recollection, with all its doubtful and marvellous
      circumstances. Were the tales of enchantment which he had read in romances
      realized in this extraordinary girl? Could she transport herself from the
      walled and guarded Castle of Lochleven, moated with its broad lake,
      (towards which he cast back a look as if to ascertain it was still in
      existence,) and watched with such scrupulous care as the safety of a
      nation demanded?&mdash;Could she surmount all these obstacles, and make
      such careless and dangerous use of her liberty, as to engage herself
      publicly in a quarrel in a village fair? Roland was unable to determine
      whether the exertions which it must have cost her to gain her freedom or
      the use to which she had put it, rendered her the most unaccountable
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in these meditations, he kept his gaze fixed on the subject of them;
      and in every casual motion, discovered, or thought he discovered,
      something which reminded him still more strongly of Catherine Seyton. It
      occurred to him more than once, indeed, that he might be deceiving himself
      by exaggerating some casual likeness into absolute identity. But then the
      meeting at the hostelrie of Saint Michael's returned to his mind, and it
      seemed in the highest degree improbable, that, under such various
      circumstances, mere imagination should twice have found opportunity to
      play him the selfsame trick. This time, however, he determined to have his
      doubts resolved, and for this purpose he sate during the rest of the play
      like a greyhound in the slip, ready to spring upon the hare the instant
      that she was started. The damsel, whom he watched attentively lest she
      should escape in the crowd when the spectacle was closed, sate as if
      perfectly unconscious that she was observed. But the worthy Doctor marked
      the direction of his eyes, and magnanimously suppressed his own
      inclination to become the Theseus to this Hippolyta, in deference to the
      rights of hospitality, which enjoined him to forbear interference with the
      pleasurable pursuits of his young friend. He passed one or two formal
      gibes upon the fixed attention which the page paid to the unknown, and
      upon his own jealousy; adding, however, that if both were to be presented
      to the patient at once, he had little doubt she would think the younger
      man the sounder prescription. &ldquo;I fear me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we shall have no
      news of the knave Auchtermuchty for some time, since the vermin whom I
      sent after him seem to have proved corbie-messengers. So you have an hour
      or two on your hands, Master Page; and as the minstrels are beginning to
      strike up, now the play is ended, why, an you incline for a dance, yonder
      is the green, and there sits your partner&mdash;I trust you will hold me
      perfect in my diagnostics, since I see with half an eye what disease you
      are sick of, and have administered a pleasing remedy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Discernit sapiens res</i> (as Chambers hath it) <i>quas
    confundit asellus</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The page hardly heard the end of the learned adage, or the charge which
      the Chamberlain gave him to be within reach, in case of the wains arriving
      suddenly, and sooner than expected&mdash;so eager he was at once to shake
      himself free of his learned associate, and to satisfy his curiosity
      regarding the unknown damsel. Yet in the haste with which he made towards
      her he found time to reflect, that, in order to secure an opportunity of
      conversing with her in private, he must not alarm her at first accosting
      her. He therefore composed his manner and gait, and advancing with
      becoming self-confidence before three or four country-fellows who were
      intent on the same design, but knew not so well how to put their request
      into shape, he acquainted her that he, as the deputy of the venerable
      Chamberlain, requested the honour of her hand as a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The venerable Chamberlain,&rdquo; said the damsel frankly, reaching the page
      her hand, &ldquo;does very well to exercise this part of his privilege by
      deputy; and I suppose the laws of the revels leave me no choice but to
      accept of his faithful delegate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided, fair damsel,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;his choice of a delegate is not
      altogether distasteful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that, fair sir,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;I will tell you more when we
      have danced the first measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine Seyton had admirable skill in gestic lore, and was sometimes
      called on to dance for the amusement of her royal mistress. Roland Graeme
      had often been a spectator of her skill, and sometimes, at the Queen's
      command, Catherine's partner on such occasions. He was, therefore,
      perfectly acquainted with Catherine's mode of dancing; and observed that
      his present partner, in grace, in agility, in quickness of ear, and
      precision of execution, exactly resembled her, save that the Scottish jig,
      which he now danced with her, required a more violent and rapid motion,
      and more rustic agility, than the stately pavens, lavoltas, and
      courantoes, which he had seen her execute in the chamber of Queen Mary.
      The active duties of the dance left him little time for reflection, and
      none for conversation; but when their <i>pas de deux</i> was finished,
      amidst the acclamations of the villagers, who had seldom witnessed such an
      exhibition, he took an opportunity, when they yielded up the green to
      another couple, to use the privilege of a partner and enter into
      conversation with the mysterious maiden, whom he still held by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair partner, may I not crave the name of her who has graced me thus
      far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said the maiden; &ldquo;but it is a question whether I shall answer
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because nobody gives anything for nothing&mdash;and you can tell me
      nothing in return which I care to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I not tell you my name and lineage, in exchange for yours?&rdquo;
       returned Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered the maiden, &ldquo;for you know little of either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; said the page, somewhat angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrath you not for the matter,&rdquo; said the damsel; &ldquo;I will show you in an
      instant that I know more of you than you do of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered Graeme; &ldquo;for whom then do you take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the wild falcon,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;whom a dog brought in his mouth to a
      certain castle, when he was but an unfledged eyas&mdash;for the hawk whom
      men dare not fly, lest he should check at game, and pounce on carrion&mdash;whom
      folk must keep hooded till he has the proper light of his eyes, and can
      discover good from evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;be it so,&rdquo; replied Roland Graeme; &ldquo;I guess at a part of your
      parable, fair mistress mine&mdash;and perhaps I know as much of you as you
      do of me, and can well dispense with the information which you are so
      niggard in giving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove that,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;and I will give you credit for more
      penetration than I judged you to be gifted withal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be proved instantly,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme. &ldquo;The first letter of
      your name is S, and the last N.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable,&rdquo; said his partner, &ldquo;guess on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases you to-day,&rdquo; continued Roland, &ldquo;to wear the snood and kirtle,
      and perhaps you may be seen to-morrow in hat and feather, hose and
      doublet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the clout! in the clout! you have hit the very white,&rdquo; said the
      damsel, suppressing a great inclination to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can switch men's eyes out of their heads, as well as the heart out of
      their bosoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These last words were uttered in a low and tender tone, which, to Roland's
      great mortification, and somewhat to his displeasure, was so far from
      allaying, that it greatly increased, his partner's disposition to
      laughter. She could scarce compose herself while she replied, &ldquo;If you had
      thought my hand so formidable,&rdquo; extricating it from his hold, &ldquo;you would
      not have grasped it so hard; but I perceive you know me so fully, that
      there is no occasion to show you my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair Catherine,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;he were unworthy ever to have seen you,
      far less to have dwelt so long in the same service, and under the same
      roof with you, who could mistake your air, your gesture, your step in
      walking or in dancing, the turn of your neck, the symmetry of your form&mdash;none
      could be so dull as not to recognize you by so many proofs; but for me, I
      could swear even to that tress of hair that escapes from under your
      muffler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to the face, of course, which that muffler covers,&rdquo; said the maiden,
      removing her veil, and in an instant endeavouring to replace it. She
      showed the features of Catherine; but an unusual degree of petulant
      impatience inflamed them, when, from some awkwardness in her management of
      the muffler, she was unable again to adjust it with that dexterity which
      was a principal accomplishment of the coquettes of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fiend rive the rag to tatters!&rdquo; said the damsel, as the veil
      fluttered about her shoulders, with an accent so earnest and decided, that
      it made the page start. He looked again at the damsel's face, but the
      information which his eyes received, was to the same purport as before. He
      assisted her to adjust her muffler, and both were for an instant silent.
      The damsel spoke first, for Roland Graeme was overwhelmed with surprise at
      the contrarieties which Catherine Seyton seemed to include in her person
      and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised,&rdquo; said the damsel to him, &ldquo;at what you see and hear&mdash;But
      the times which make females men, are least of all fitted for men to
      become women; yet you yourself are in danger of such a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I in danger of becoming effeminate!&rdquo; said the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you, for all the boldness of your reply,&rdquo; said the damsel. &ldquo;When you
      should hold fast your religion, because it is assailed on all sides by
      rebels, traitors, and heretics, you let it glide out of your breast like
      water grasped in the hand. If you are driven from the faith of your
      fathers from fear of a traitor, is not that womanish?&mdash;If you are
      cajoled by the cunning arguments of a trumpeter of heresy, or the praises
      of a puritanic old woman, is not that womanish?&mdash;If you are bribed by
      the hope of spoil and preferment, is not that womanish?&mdash;And when you
      wonder at my venting a threat or an execration, should you not wonder at
      yourself, who, pretending to a gentle name and aspiring to knighthood, can
      be at the same time cowardly, silly, and self-interested!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would that a man would bring such a charge,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;he should
      see, ere his life was a minute older, whether he had cause to term me
      coward or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of such big words,&rdquo; answered the maiden; &ldquo;you said but anon that I
      sometimes wear hose and doublet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But remain still Catharine Seyton, wear what you list,&rdquo; said the page,
      endeavouring again to possess himself of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You indeed are pleased to call me so,&rdquo; replied the maiden, evading his
      intention, &ldquo;but I have many other names besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you not reply to that,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;by which you are
      distinguished beyond every other maiden in Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel, unallured by his praises, still kept aloof, and sung with
      gaiety a verse from an old ballad,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, some do call me Jack, sweet love,
    And some do call me Gill;
  But when I ride to Holyrood,
    My name is Wilful Will.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilful Will&rdquo; exclaimed the page, impatiently; &ldquo;say rather Will o' the
      Wisp&mdash;Jack with the Lantern&mdash;for never was such a deceitful or
      wandering meteor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I be such,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;I ask no fools to follow me&mdash;If
      they do so, it is at their own pleasure, and must be on their own proper
      peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, dearest Catherine,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;be for one instant
      serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will call me your dearest Catherine, when I have given you so many
      names to choose upon,&rdquo; replied the damsel, &ldquo;I would ask you how, supposing
      me for two or three hours of my life escaped from yonder tower, you have
      the cruelty to ask me to be serious during the only merry moments I have
      seen perhaps for months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but, fair Catherine, there are moments of deep and true feeling,
      which are worth ten thousand years of the liveliest mirth; and such was
      that of yesterday, when you so nearly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So nearly what?&rdquo; demanded the damsel, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you approached your lips so near to the sign you had traced on my
      forehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother of Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed she, in a yet fiercer tone, and with a more
      masculine manner than she had yet exhibited,-&ldquo;Catherine Seyton approach
      her lips to a man's brow, and thou that man!&mdash;vassal, thou liest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page stood astonished; but, conceiving he had alarmed the damsel's
      delicacy by alluding to the enthusiasm of a moment, and the manner in
      which she had expressed it, he endeavoured to falter forth an apology. His
      excuses, though he was unable to give them any regular shape, were
      accepted by his companion, who had indeed suppressed her indignation after
      its first explosion&mdash;&ldquo;Speak no more on't,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now let us
      part; our conversation may attract more notice than is convenient for
      either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but allow me at least to follow you to some sequestered place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare not,&rdquo; replied the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;dare not? where is it you dare go, where I dare
      not follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fear a Will o' the Wisp,&rdquo; said the damsel; &ldquo;how would you face a
      fiery dragon, with an enchantress mounted on its back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Sir Eger, Sir Grime, or Sir Greysteil,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;but be there
      such toys to be seen here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to Mother Nicneven's,&rdquo; answered the maid; &ldquo;and she is witch enough
      to rein the horned devil, with a red silk thread for a bridle, and a
      rowan-tree switch for a whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow you,&rdquo; said the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be at some distance,&rdquo; said the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      And wrapping her mantle round her with more success than on her former
      attempt, she mingled with the throng, and walked towards the village,
      heedfully followed by Roland Graeme at some distance, and under every
      precaution which he could use to prevent his purpose from being observed.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Yes, it is he whose eyes look'd on thy childhood,
  And watch'd with trembling hope thy dawn of youth,
  That now, with these same eyeballs dimm'd with age,
  And dimmer yet with tears, sees thy dishonour.
                                OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the entrance of the principal, or indeed, so to speak, the only street
      in Kinross, the damsel, whose steps were pursued by Roland Graeme, cast a
      glance behind her, as if to be certain he had not lost trace of her and
      then plunged down a very narrow lane which ran betwixt two rows of poor
      and ruinous cottages. She paused for a second at the door of one of those
      miserable tenements, again cast her eye up the lane towards Roland, then
      lifted the latch, opened the door, and disappeared from his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      With whatever haste the page followed her example, the difficulty which he
      found in discovering the trick of the latch, which did not work quite in
      the usual manner, and in pushing open the door, which did not yield to his
      first effort, delayed for a minute or two his entrance into the cottage. A
      dark and smoky passage led, as usual, betwixt the exterior wall of the
      house, and the <i>hallan</i>, or clay wall, which served as a partition
      betwixt it and the interior. At the end of this passage, and through the
      partition, was a door leading into the <i>ben</i>, or inner chamber of the
      cottage, and when Roland Graeme's hand was upon the latch of this door, a
      female voice pronounced, &ldquo;<i>Benedictus qui veniat in nomine Domini,
      damnandus qui in nomine inimici.</i>&rdquo; On entering the apartment, he
      perceived the figure which the chamberlain had pointed out to him as
      Mother Nicneven, seated beside the lowly hearth. But there was no other
      person in the room. Roland Graeme gazed around in surprise at the
      disappearance of Catherine Seyton, without paying much regard to the
      supposed sorceress, until she attracted and riveted his regard by the tone
      in which she asked him&mdash;&ldquo;What seekest thou here?&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0504}.jpg" alt="{0504}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0504}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek,&rdquo; said the page, with much embarrassment; &ldquo;I seek&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his answer was cut short, when the old woman, drawing her huge gray
      eyebrows sternly together, with a frown which knitted her brow into a
      thousand wrinkles, arose, and erecting herself up to her full natural
      size, tore the kerchief from her head, and seizing Roland by the arm, made
      two strides across the floor of the apartment to a small window through
      which the light fell full on her face, and showed the astonished youth the
      countenance of Magdalen Graeme.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Roland,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thine eyes
      deceive thee not; they show thee truly the features of her whom thou hast
      thyself deceived, whose wine thou hast turned into gall, her bread of
      joyfulness into bitter poison, her hope into the blackest despair&mdash;it
      is she who now demands of thee, what seekest thou here?&mdash;She whose
      heaviest sin towards Heaven hath been, that she loved thee even better
      than the weal of the whole church, and could not without reluctance
      surrender thee even in the cause of God&mdash;she now asks you, what
      seekest thou here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke, she kept her broad black eye riveted on the youth's face,
      with the expression with which the eagle regards his prey ere he tears it
      to pieces. Roland felt himself at the moment incapable either of reply or
      evasion. This extraordinary enthusiast had preserved over him in some
      measure the ascendency which she had acquired during his childhood; and,
      besides, he knew the violence of her passions and her impatience of
      contradiction, and was sensible that almost any reply which he could make,
      was likely to throw her into an ecstasy of rage. He was therefore silent;
      and Magdalen Graeme proceeded with increasing enthusiasm in her apostrophe&mdash;&ldquo;Once
      more, what seek'st thou, false boy?&mdash;seek'st thou the honour thou
      hast renounced, the faith thou hast abandoned, the hopes thou hast
      destroyed?&mdash;Or didst thou seek me, the sole protectress of thy youth,
      the only parent whom thou hast known, that thou mayest trample on my gray
      hairs, even as thou hast already trampled on the best wishes of my heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, mother,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;but, in truth and reason, I
      deserve not your blame. I have been treated amongst you&mdash;even by
      yourself, my revered parent, as well as by others&mdash;as one who lacked
      the common attributes of free-will and human reason, or was at least
      deemed unfit to exercise them. A land of enchantment have I been led into,
      and spells have been cast around me&mdash;every one has met me in disguise&mdash;every
      one has spoken to me in parables&mdash;I have been like one who walks in a
      weary and bewildering dream; and now you blame me that I have not the
      sense, and judgment, and steadiness of a waking, and a disenchanted, and a
      reasonable man, who knows what he is doing, and wherefore he does it. If
      one must walk with masks and spectres, who waft themselves from place to
      place as it were in vision rather than reality, it might shake the
      soundest faith and turn the wisest head. I sought, since I must needs avow
      my folly, the same Catherine Seyton with whom you made me first
      acquainted, and whom I most strangely find in this village of Kinross,
      gayest among the revellers, when I had but just left her in the
      well-guarded castle of Lochleven, the sad attendant of an imprisoned
      Queen-I sought her, and in her place I find you, my mother, more strangely
      disguised than even she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what hadst thou to do with Catherine Seyton?&rdquo; said the matron,
      sternly; &ldquo;is this a time or a world to follow maidens, or to dance around
      a Maypole? When the trumpet summons every true-hearted Scotsman around the
      standard of the true sovereign, shalt thou be found loitering in a lady's
      bower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Heaven, nor imprisoned in the rugged walls of an island castle!&rdquo;
       answered Roland Graeme: &ldquo;I would the blast were to sound even now, for I
      fear that nothing less loud will dispel the chimerical visions by which I
      am surrounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt not that it will be winded,&rdquo; said the matron, &ldquo;and that so
      fearfully loud, that Scotland will never hear the like until the last and
      loudest blast of all shall announce to mountain and to valley that time is
      no more. Meanwhile, be thou but brave and constant&mdash;Serve God and
      honour thy sovereign&mdash;Abide by thy religion&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I
      will not&mdash;I dare not ask thee the truth of the terrible surmises I
      have heard touching thy falling away&mdash;perfect not that accursed
      sacrifice&mdash;and yet, even at this late hour, thou mayest be what I
      have hoped for the son of my dearest hope&mdash;what say I? the son of <i>my</i>
      hope&mdash;thou shalt be the hope of Scotland, her boast and her honour!&mdash;Even
      thy wildest and most foolish wishes may perchance be fulfilled&mdash;I
      might blush to mingle meaner motives with the noble guerdon I hold out to
      thee&mdash;It shames me, being such as I am, to mention the idle passions
      of youth, save with contempt and the purpose of censure. But we must bribe
      children to wholesome medicine by the offer of cates, and youth to
      honourable achievement with the promise of pleasure. Mark me, therefore,
      Roland. The love of Catherine Seyton will follow him only who shall
      achieve the freedom of her mistress; and believe, it may be one day in
      thine own power to be that happy lover. Cast, therefore, away doubt and
      fear, and prepare to do what religion calls for, what thy country demands
      of thee, what thy duty as a subject and as a servant alike require at your
      hand; and be assured, even the idlest or wildest wishes of thy heart will
      be most readily attained by following the call of thy duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she ceased speaking, a double knock was heard against the inner door.
      The matron hastily adjusting her muffler, and resuming her chair by the
      hearth, demanded who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Salve in nomine sancto</i>,&rdquo; was answered from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Salvete et vos</i>,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a man entered in the ordinary dress of a nobleman's retainer, wearing
      at his girdle a sword and buckler&mdash;&ldquo;I sought you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my
      mother, and him whom I see with you.&rdquo; Then addressing himself to Roland
      Graeme, he said to him, &ldquo;Hast thou not a packet from George Douglas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the page, suddenly recollecting that which had been
      committed to his charge in the morning, &ldquo;but I may not deliver it to any
      one without some token that they have a right to ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say well,&rdquo; replied the serving-man, and whispered into his ear, &ldquo;The
      packet which I ask is the report to his father&mdash;will this token
      suffice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will,&rdquo; replied the page, and taking the packet from his bosom, gave it
      to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will return presently,&rdquo; said the serving-man, and left the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland had now sufficiently recovered his surprise to accost his relative
      in turn, and request to know the reason why he found her in so precarious
      a disguise, and a place so dangerous&mdash;&ldquo;You cannot be ignorant,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;of the hatred that the Lady of Lochleven bears to those of your&mdash;that
      is of our religion&mdash;your present disguise lays you open to suspicion
      of a different kind, but inferring no less hazard; and whether as a
      Catholic, or as a sorceress, or as a friend to the unfortunate Queen, you
      are in equal danger, if apprehended within the bounds of the Douglas; and
      in the chamberlain who administers their authority, you have, for his own
      reasons, an enemy, and a bitter one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the matron, her eyes kindling with triumph; &ldquo;I know
      that, vain of his school-craft, and carnal wisdom, Luke Lundin views with
      jealousy and hatred the blessings which the saints have conferred on my
      prayers, and on the holy relics, before the touch, nay, before the bare
      presence of which, disease and death have so often been known to retreat.&mdash;I
      know he would rend and tear me; but there is a chain and a muzzle on the
      ban dog that shall restrain his fury, and the Master's servant shall not
      be offended by him until the Master's work is wrought. When that hour
      comes, let the shadows of the evening descend on me in thunder and in
      tempest; the time shall be welcome that relieves my eyes from seeing
      guilt, and my ears from listening to blasphemy. Do thou but be constant&mdash;play
      thy part as I have played and will play mine, and my release shall be like
      that of a blessed martyr whose ascent to heaven angels hail with psalm and
      song, while earth pursues him with hiss and with execration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she concluded, the serving-man again entered the cottage, and said,
      &ldquo;All is well! the time holds for to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time? what holds?&rdquo; exclaimed Roland Graeme; &ldquo;I trust I have given
      the Douglas's packet to no wrong&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content yourself, young man,&rdquo; answered the serving-man; &ldquo;thou hast my
      word and token.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not if the token be right,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;and I care not much
      for the word of a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the matron, &ldquo;although thou mayest have given a packet
      delivered to thy charge by one of the Queen's rebels into the hand of a
      loyal subject&mdash;there were no great mistake in that, thou hot-brained
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Andrew, there were foul mistake, though,&rdquo; answered the page; &ldquo;it
      is the very spirit of my duty, in this first stage of chivalry, to be
      faithful to my trust; and had the devil given me a message to discharge, I
      would not (so I had plighted my faith to the contrary) betray his counsel
      to an angel of light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by the love I once bore thee,&rdquo; said the matron, &ldquo;I could slay thee
      with mine own hand, when I hear thee talk of a dearer faith being due to
      rebels and heretics, than thou owest to thy church and thy prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient, my good sister,&rdquo; said the serving-man; &ldquo;I will give him such
      reasons as shall counterbalance the scruples which beset him&mdash;-the
      spirit is honourable, though now it may be mistimed and misplaced.&mdash;Follow
      me, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ere I go to call this stranger to a reckoning,&rdquo; said the page to the
      matron, &ldquo;is there nothing I can do for your comfort and safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;nothing, save what will lead more to thine own
      honour;&mdash;the saints who have protected me thus far, will lend me
      succour as I need it. Tread the path of glory that is before thee, and
      only think of me as the creature on earth who will be most delighted to
      hear of thy fame.&mdash;Follow the stranger&mdash;he hath tidings for you
      that you little expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger remained on the threshold as if waiting for Roland, and as
      soon as he saw him put himself in motion, he moved on before at a quick
      pace. Diving still deeper down the lane, Roland perceived that it was now
      bordered by buildings upon the one side only, and that the other was
      fenced by a high old wall, over which some trees extended their branches.
      Descending a good way farther, they came to a small door in the wall.
      Roland's guide paused, looked around an instant to see if any one were
      within sight, then taking a key from his pocket, opened the door and
      entered, making a sign to Roland Graeme to follow him. He did so, and the
      stranger locked the door carefully on the inside. During this operation
      the page had a moment to look around, and perceived that he was in a small
      orchard very trimly kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger led him through an alley or two, shaded by trees loaded with
      summer-fruit, into a pleached arbour, where, taking the turf-seat which
      was on the one side, he motioned to Roland to occupy that which was
      opposite to him, and, after a momentary silence, opened the conversation
      as follows: &ldquo;You have asked a better warrant than the word of a mere
      stranger, to satisfy you that I have the authority of George of Douglas
      for possessing myself of the packet intrusted to your charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely the point on which I demand reckoning of you,&rdquo; said
      Roland. &ldquo;I fear I have acted hastily; if so, I must redeem my error as I
      best may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold me then as a perfect stranger?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Look at my face
      more attentively, and see if the features do not resemble those of a man
      much known to you formerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland gazed attentively; but the ideas recalled to his mind were so
      inconsistent with the mean and servile dress of the person before him,
      that he did not venture to express the opinion which he was irresistibly
      induced to form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said the stranger, observing his embarrassment, &ldquo;you do
      indeed see before you the unfortunate Father Ambrosius, who once accounted
      his ministry crowned in your preservation from the snares of heresy, but
      who is now condemned to lament thee as a castaway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme's kindness of heart was at least equal to his vivacity of
      temper&mdash;he could not bear to see his ancient and honoured master and
      spiritual guide in a situation which inferred a change of fortune so
      melancholy, but throwing himself at his feet, grasped his knees and wept
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean these tears, my son?&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;if they are shed for
      your own sins and follies, surely they are gracious showers, and may avail
      thee much&mdash;but weep not, if they fall on my account. You indeed see
      the Superior of the community of Saint Mary's in the dress of a poor
      sworder, who gives his master the use of his blade and buckler, and, if
      needful, of his life, for a coarse livery coat and four marks by the year.
      But such a garb suits the time, and, in the period of the church militant,
      as well becomes her prelates, as staff, mitre, and crosier, in the days of
      the church's triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what fate,&rdquo; said the page&mdash;&ldquo;and yet why,&rdquo; added he, checking
      himself, &ldquo;need I ask? Catherine Seyton in some sort prepared me for this.
      But that the change should be so absolute&mdash;the destruction so
      complete!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said the Abbot Ambrosius, &ldquo;thine own eyes beheld, in my
      unworthy elevation to the Abbot's stall, the last especial act of holy
      solemnity which shall be seen in the church of Saint Mary's, until it
      shall please Heaven to turn back the captivity of the church. For the
      present, the shepherd is smitten&mdash;ay, well-nigh to the earth&mdash;the
      flock are scattered, and the shrines of saints and martyrs, and pious
      benefactors to the church, are given to the owls of night, and the satyrs
      of the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your brother, the Knight of Avenel&mdash;could he do nothing for your
      protection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He himself hath fallen under the suspicion of the ruling powers,&rdquo; said
      the Abbot, &ldquo;who are as unjust to their friends as they are cruel to their
      enemies. I could not grieve at it, did I hope it might estrange him from
      his cause; but I know the soul of Halbert, and I rather fear it will drive
      him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy cause, by some deed which may
      be yet more destructive to the church, and more offensive to Heaven.
      Enough of this; and now to the business of our meeting.&mdash;I trust you
      will hold it sufficient if I pass my word to you that the packet of which
      you were lately the bearer, was designed for my hands by George of
      Douglas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;is George of Douglas&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true friend to his Queen, Roland; and will soon, I trust, have his eyes
      opened to the errors of his (miscalled) church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is he to his father, and what to the Lady of Lochleven, who has
      been as a mother to him?&rdquo; said the page impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best friend to both, in time and through eternity,&rdquo; said the Abbot,
      &ldquo;if he shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming the evil they have
      wrought, and are still working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I like not that good service which begins in
      breach of trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame not thy scruples, my son,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;but the time which
      has wrenched asunder the allegiance of Christians to the church, and of
      subjects to their king, has dissolved all the lesser bonds of society;
      and, in such days, mere human ties must no more restrain our progress,
      than the brambles and briers which catch hold of his garments, should
      delay the path of a pilgrim who travels to pay his vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my father,&rdquo;&mdash;said the youth, and then stopt short in a
      hesitating manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak on, my son,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;speak without fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me not offend you then,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;when I say, that it is even
      this which our adversaries charge against us; when they say that, shaping
      the means according to the end, we are willing to commit great moral evil
      in order that we may work out eventual good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heretics have played their usual arts on you, my son,&rdquo; said the
      Abbot; &ldquo;they would willingly deprive us of the power of acting wisely and
      secretly, though their possession of superior force forbids our contending
      with them on terms of equality. They have reduced us to a state of
      exhausted weakness, and now would fain proscribe the means by which
      weakness, through all the range of nature, supplies the lack of strength
      and defends itself against its potent enemies. As well might the hound say
      to the hare, use not these wily turns to escape me, but contend with me in
      pitched battle, as the armed and powerful heretic demand of the
      down-trodden and oppressed Catholic to lay aside the wisdom of the
      serpent, by which alone they may again hope to raise up the Jerusalem over
      which they weep, and which it is their duty to rebuild&mdash;But more of
      this hereafter. And now, my son, I command thee on thy faith to tell me
      truly and particularly what has chanced to thee since we parted, and what
      is the present state of thy conscience. Thy relation, our sister Magdalen,
      is a woman of excellent gifts, blessed with a zeal which neither doubt nor
      danger can quench; but yet it is not a zeal altogether according to
      knowledge; wherefore, my son, I would willingly be myself thy
      interrogator, and thy counsellor, in these days of darkness and
      stratagem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the respect which he owed to his first instructor, Roland Graeme went
      rapidly through the events which the reader is acquainted with; and while
      he disguised not from the prelate the impression which had been made on
      his mind by the arguments of the preacher Henderson, he accidentally and
      almost involuntarily gave his Father Confessor to understand the influence
      which Catherine Seyton had acquired over his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with joy I discover, my dearest son,&rdquo; replied the Abbot, &ldquo;that I
      have arrived in time to arrest thee on the verge of the precipice to which
      thou wert approaching. These doubts of which you complain, are the weeds
      which naturally grow up in a strong soil, and require the careful hand of
      the husbandman to eradicate them. Thou must study a little volume, which I
      will impart to thee in fitting time, in which, by Our Lady's grace, I have
      placed in somewhat a clearer light than heretofore, the points debated
      betwixt us and these heretics, who sow among the wheat the same tares
      which were formerly privily mingled with the good seed by the Albigenses
      and the Lollards. But it is not by reason alone that you must hope to
      conquer these insinuations of the enemy: It is sometimes by timely
      resistance, but oftener by timely flight. You must shut your ears against
      the arguments of the heresiarch, when circumstances permit you not to
      withdraw the foot from his company. Anchor your thoughts upon the service
      of Our Lady, while he is expending in vain his heretical sophistry. Are
      you unable to maintain your attention on heavenly objects&mdash;think
      rather on thine own earthly pleasures, than tempt Providence and the
      Saints by giving an attentive ear to the erring doctrine&mdash;think of
      thy hawk, thy hound, thine angling rod, thy sword and buckler&mdash;think
      even of Catherine Seyton, rather than give thy soul to the lessons of the
      tempter. Alas! my son, believe not that, worn out with woes, and bent more
      by affliction than by years, I have forgotten the effect of beauty over
      the heart of youth. Even in the watches of the night, broken by thoughts
      of an imprisoned Queen, a distracted kingdom, a church laid waste and
      ruinous, come other thoughts than these suggest, and feelings which
      belonged to an earlier and happier course of life. Be it so&mdash;we must
      bear our load as we may: and not in vain are these passions implanted in
      our breast, since, as now in thy case, they may come in aid of resolutions
      founded upon higher grounds. Yet beware, my son&mdash;this Catherine
      Seyton is the daughter of one of Scotland's proudest, as well as most
      worthy barons; and thy state may not suffer thee, as yet, to aspire so
      high. But thus it is&mdash;Heaven works its purposes through human folly;
      and Douglas's ambitious affection, as well as thine, shall contribute
      alike to the desired end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, my father,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;my suspicions are then true!&mdash;Douglas
      loves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does; and with a love as much misplaced as thine own; but beware of
      him&mdash;cross him not&mdash;thwart him not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him not cross or thwart me,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;for I will not yield him
      an inch of way, had he in his body the soul of every Douglas that has
      lived since the time of the Dark Gray Man.&rdquo; [Footnote: By an ancient,
      though improbable tradition, the Douglasses are said to have derived their
      name from a champion who had greatly distinguished himself in an action.
      When the king demanded by whom the battle had been won, the attendants are
      said to have answered, &ldquo;Sholto Douglas, sir;&rdquo; which is said to mean,
      &ldquo;Yonder dark gray man.&rdquo; But the name is undoubtedly territorial, and taken
      from Douglas river and vale.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, have patience, idle boy, and reflect that your suit can never
      interfere with his.&mdash;But a truce with these vanities, and let us
      better employ the little space which still remains to us to spend
      together. To thy knees, my son, and resume the long-interrupted duty of
      confession, that, happen what may, the hour may find in thee a faithful
      Catholic, relieved from the guilt of his sins by authority of the Holy
      Church. Could I but tell thee, Roland, the joy with which I see thee once
      more put thy knee to its best and fittest use! <i>Quid dicis, mi fili?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Culpas meas</i>&rdquo; answered the youth; and according to the ritual of
      the Catholic Church, he confessed and received absolution, to which was
      annexed the condition of performing certain enjoined penances.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this religious ceremony was ended, an old man, in the dress of a
      peasant of the better order, approached the arbour, and greeted the Abbot.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have waited the conclusion of your devotions,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to tell you the
      youth is sought after by the chamberlain, and it were well he should
      appear without delay. Holy Saint Francis, if the halberdiers were to seek
      him here, they might sorely wrong my garden-plot&mdash;they are in office,
      and reck not where they tread, were each step on jessamine and
      clovegilly-flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will speed him forth, my brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;but alas! is it
      possible that such trifles should live in your mind at a crisis so awful
      as that which is now impending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; answered the proprietor of the garden, for such he was,
      &ldquo;how oft shall I pray you to keep your high counsel for high minds like
      your own? What have you required of me, that I have not granted
      unresistingly, though with an aching heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would require of you to be yourself, my brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot
      Ambrosius; &ldquo;to remember what you were, and to what your early vows have
      bound you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee, Father Ambrosius,&rdquo; replied the gardener, &ldquo;the patience of
      the best saint that ever said pater-noster, would be exhausted by the
      trials to which you have put mine&mdash;What I have been, it skills not to
      speak at present-no one knows better than yourself, father, what I
      renounced, in hopes to find ease and quiet during the remainder of my days&mdash;and
      no one better knows how my retreat has been invaded, my fruit-trees
      broken, my flower-beds trodden down, my quiet frightened away, and my very
      sleep driven from my bed, since ever this poor Queen, God bless her, hath
      been sent to Lochleven.&mdash;I blame her not; being a prisoner, it is
      natural she should wish to get out from so vile a hold, where there is
      scarcely any place even for a tolerable garden, and where the water-mists,
      as I am told, blight all the early blossoms&mdash;I say, I cannot blame
      her for endeavouring for her freedom; but why I should be drawn into the
      scheme&mdash;why my harmless arbours, that I planted with my own hands,
      should become places of privy conspiracy-why my little quay, which I built
      for my own fishing boat, should have become a haven for secret
      embarkations&mdash;in short, why I should be dragged into matters where
      both heading and hanging are like to be the issue, I profess to you,
      reverend father, I am totally ignorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; answered the Abbot, &ldquo;you are wise, and ought to know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not&mdash;I am not&mdash;I am not wise,&rdquo; replied the horticulturist,
      pettishly, and stopping his ears with his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;I was never
      called wise but when men wanted to engage me in some action of notorious
      folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not good neither,&rdquo; said the peevish gardener; &ldquo;I am neither good nor
      wise&mdash;Had I been wise, you would not have been admitted here; and
      were I good, methinks I should send you elsewhere to hatch plots for
      destroying the quiet of the country. What signifies disputing about queen
      or king,&mdash;when men may sit at peace&mdash;<i>sub umbra vitis sui?</i>
      and so would I do, after the precept of Holy Writ, were I, as you term me,
      wise or good. But such as I am, my neck is in the yoke, and you make me
      draw what weight you list.&mdash;Follow me, youngster. This reverend
      father, who makes in his jackman's dress nearly as reverend a figure as I
      myself, will agree with me in one thing at least, and that is, that you
      have been long enough here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow the good father, Roland,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;and remember my words&mdash;a
      day is approaching that will try the temper of all true Scotsmen&mdash;may
      thy heart prove faithful as the steel of thy blade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page bowed in silence, and they parted; the gardener, notwithstanding
      his advanced age, walking on before him very briskly, and muttering as he
      went, partly to himself, partly to his companion, after the manner of old
      men of weakened intellects&mdash;&ldquo;When I was great,&rdquo; thus ran his
      maundering, &ldquo;and had my mule and my ambling palfrey at command, I warrant
      you I could have as well flown through the air as have walked at this
      pace. I had my gout and my rheumatics, and an hundred things besides, that
      hung fetters on my heels; and, now, thanks to Our Lady, and honest labour,
      I can walk with any good man of my age in the kingdom of Fife&mdash;Fy
      upon it, that experience should be so long in coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was thus muttering, his eye fell upon the branch of a pear-tree
      which drooped down for want of support, and at once forgetting his haste,
      the old man stopped and set seriously about binding it up. Roland Graeme
      had both readiness, neatness of hand, and good nature in abundance; he
      immediately lent his aid, and in a minute or two the bough was supported,
      and tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to the old man, who looked at
      it with great complaisance. &ldquo;They are bergamots,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if you
      will come ashore in autumn, you shall taste of them&mdash;the like are not
      in Lochleven Castle&mdash;the garden there is a poor pin-fold, and the
      gardener, Hugh Houkham, hath little skill of his craft&mdash;so come
      ashore, Master Page, in autumn, when you would eat pears. But what am I
      thinking of&mdash;ere that time come, they may have given thee sour pears
      for plums. Take an old man's advice, youth, one who hath seen many days,
      and sat in higher places than thou canst hope for&mdash;bend thy sword
      into a pruning-hook, and make a dibble of thy dagger&mdash;thy days shall
      be the longer, and thy health the better for it,&mdash;and come to aid me
      in my garden, and I will teach thee the real French fashion of <i>imping</i>,
      which the Southron call graffing. Do this, and do it without loss of time,
      for there is a whirlwind coming over the land, and only those shall escape
      who lie too much beneath the storm to have their boughs broken by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he dismissed Roland Graeme, through a different door from that
      by which he had entered, signed a cross, and pronounced a benedicite as
      they parted, and then, still muttering to himself, retired into the
      garden, and locked the door on the inside.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Pray God she prove not masculine ere long!
                        KING HENRY VI.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dismissed from the old man's garden, Roland Graeme found that a grassy
      paddock, in which sauntered two cows, the property of the gardener, still
      separated him from the village. He paced through it, lost in meditation
      upon the words of the Abbot. Father Ambrosius had, with success enough,
      exerted over him that powerful influence which the guardians and
      instructors of our childhood possess over our more mature youth. And yet,
      when Roland looked back upon what the father had said, he could not but
      suspect that he had rather sought to evade entering into the controversy
      betwixt the churches, than to repel the objections and satisfy the doubts
      which the lectures of Henderson had excited. &ldquo;For this he had no time,&rdquo;
       said the page to himself, &ldquo;neither have I now calmness and learning
      sufficient to judge upon points of such magnitude. Besides, it were base
      to quit my faith while the wind of fortune sets against it, unless I were
      so placed, that my conversion, should it take place, were free as light
      from the imputation of self-interest. I was bred a Catholic&mdash;bred in
      the faith of Bruce and Wallace&mdash;I will hold that faith till time and
      reason shall convince me that it errs. I will serve this poor Queen as a
      subject should serve an imprisoned and wronged sovereign&mdash;they who
      placed me in her service have to blame themselves&mdash;who sent me
      hither, a gentleman trained in the paths of loyalty and honour, when they
      should have sought out some truckling, cogging, double-dealing knave, who
      would have been at once the observant page of the Queen, and the
      obsequious spy of her enemies. Since I must choose betwixt aiding and
      betraying her, I will decide as becomes her servant and her subject; but
      Catherine Seyton&mdash;Catherine Seyton, beloved by Douglas and holding me
      on or off as the intervals of her leisure or caprice will permit&mdash;how
      shall I deal with the coquette?&mdash;By heaven, when I next have an
      opportunity, she shall render me some reason for her conduct, or I will
      break with her for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he formed this doughty resolution, he crossed the stile which led out
      of the little enclosure, and was almost immediately greeted by Dr. Luke
      Lundin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my most excellent young friend,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;from whence come
      you?&mdash;but I note the place.&mdash;Yes, neighbour Blinkhoolie's garden
      is a pleasant rendezvous, and you are of the age when lads look after a
      bonny lass with one eye, and a dainty plum with another. But hey! you look
      subtriste and melancholic&mdash;I fear the maiden has proved cruel, or the
      plums unripe; and surely I think neighbour Blinkhoolie's damsons can
      scarcely have been well preserved throughout the winter&mdash;he spares
      the saccharine juice on his confects. But courage, man, there are more
      Kates in Kinross; and for the immature fruit, a glass of my double
      distilled <i>aqua mirabilis&mdash;probatum est</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page darted an ireful glance at the facetious physician; but presently
      recollecting that the name Kate, which had provoked his displeasure, was
      probably but introduced for the sake of alliteration, he suppressed his
      wrath, and only asked if the wains had been heard of?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have been seeking for you this hour, to tell you that the stuff is
      in your boat, and that the boat waits your pleasure. Auchtermuchty had
      only fallen into company with an idle knave like himself, and a stoup of
      aquavitae between them. Your boatmen lie on their oars, and there have
      already been made two wefts from the warder's turret to intimate that
      those in the castle are impatient for your return. Yet there is time for
      you to take a slight repast; and, as your friend and physician, I hold it
      unfit you should face the water-breeze with an empty stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme had nothing for it but to return, with such cheer as he
      might, to the place where his boat was moored on the beach, and resisted
      all offer of refreshment, although the Doctor promised that he should
      prelude the collation with a gentle appetizer&mdash;a decoction of herbs,
      gathered and distilled by himself. Indeed, as Roland had not forgotten the
      contents of his morning cup, it is possible that the recollection induced
      him to stand firm in his refusal of all food, to which such an unpalatable
      preface was the preliminary. As they passed towards the boat, (for the
      ceremonious politeness of the worthy Chamberlain would not permit the page
      to go thither without attendance,) Roland Graeme, amidst a group who
      seemed to be assembled around a party of wandering musicians,
      distinguished, as he thought, the dress of Catherine Seyton. He shook
      himself clear from his attendant, and at one spring was in the midst of
      the crowd, and at the side of the damsel. &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;is
      it well for you to be still here?&mdash;will you not return to the
      castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with your Catherines and your castles!&rdquo; answered the maiden,
      snappishly; &ldquo;have you not had time enough already to get rid of your
      follies? Begone! I desire not your farther company, and there will be
      danger in thrusting it upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay&mdash;but if there be danger, fairest Catherine,&rdquo; replied Roland;
      &ldquo;why will you not allow me to stay and share it with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intruding fool,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;the danger is all on thine own side&mdash;the
      risk in, in plain terms, that I strike thee on the mouth with the hilt of
      my dagger.&rdquo; So saying, she turned haughtily from him, and moved through
      the crowd, who gave way in some astonishment at the masculine activity
      with which she forced her way among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roland, though much irritated, prepared to follow, he was grappled on
      the other side by Doctor Luke Lundin, who reminded him of the loaded boat,
      of the two wefts, or signals with the flag, which had been made from the
      tower, of the danger of the cold breeze to an empty stomach, and of the
      vanity of spending more time upon coy wenches and sour plums. Roland was
      thus, in a manner, dragged back to his boat, and obliged to launch her
      forth upon his return to Lochleven Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      That little voyage was speedily accomplished, and the page was greeted at
      the landing-place by the severe and caustic welcome of old Dryfesdale.
      &ldquo;So, young gallant, you are come at last, after a delay of six hours, and
      after two signals from the castle? But, I warrant, some idle junketing
      hath occupied you too deeply to think of your service or your duty. Where
      is the note of the plate and household stuff?&mdash;Pray Heaven it hath
      not been diminished under the sleeveless care of so young a gad-about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diminished under my care, Sir Steward!&rdquo; retorted the page angrily; &ldquo;say
      so in earnest, and by Heaven your gray hair shall hardly protect your
      saucy tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce with your swaggering, young esquire,&rdquo; returned the steward; &ldquo;we
      have bolts and dungeons for brawlers. Go to my lady, and swagger before
      her, if thou darest&mdash;she will give thee proper cause of offence, for
      she has waited for thee long and impatiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where then is the Lady of Lochleven?&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;for I conceive
      it is of her thou speakest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;of whom else?&rdquo; replied Dryfesdale; &ldquo;or who besides the Lady of
      Lochleven hath a right to command in this castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady of Lochleven is thy mistress,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;but mine is
      the Queen of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward looked at him fixedly for a moment, with an air in which
      suspicion and dislike were ill concealed by an affectation of contempt.
      &ldquo;The bragging cock-chicken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will betray himself by his rash
      crowing. I have marked thy altered manner in the chapel of late&mdash;ay,
      and your changing of glances at meal-time with a certain idle damsel, who,
      like thyself, laughs at all gravity and goodness. There is something about
      you, my master, which should be looked to. But, if you would know whether
      the Lady of Lochleven, or that other lady, hath a right to command thy
      service, thou wilt find them together in the Lady Mary's ante-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland hastened thither, not unwilling to escape from the ill-natured
      penetration of the old man, and marvelling at the same time what
      peculiarity could have occasioned the Lady of Lochleven's being in the
      Queen's apartment at this time of the afternoon, so much contrary to her
      usual wont. His acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning. &ldquo;She wishes,&rdquo;
       he concluded, &ldquo;to see the meeting betwixt the Queen and me on my return,
      that she may form a guess whether there is any private intelligence or
      understanding betwixt us&mdash;I must be guarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this resolution he entered the parlour, where the Queen, seated in
      her chair, with the Lady Fleming leaning upon the back of it, had already
      kept the Lady of Lochleven standing in her presence for the space of
      nearly an hour, to the manifest increase of her very visible bad humour.
      Roland Graeme, on entering the apartment, made a deep obeisance to the
      Queen, and another to the Lady, and then stood still as if to await their
      farther question. Speaking almost together, the Lady Lochleven said, &ldquo;So,
      young man, you are returned at length?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then stopped indignantly short, while the Queen went on without
      regarding her&mdash;&ldquo;Roland, you are welcome home to us&mdash;you have
      proved the true dove and not the raven&mdash;Yet I am sure I could have
      forgiven you, if, once dismissed, from this water-circled ark of ours, you
      had never again returned to us. I trust you have brought back an
      olive-branch, for our kind and worthy hostess has chafed herself much on
      account of your long absence, and we never needed more some symbol of
      peace and reconciliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grieve I should have been detained, madam,&rdquo; answered the page; &ldquo;but
      from the delay of the person intrusted with the matters for which I was
      sent, I did not receive them till late in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you there now,&rdquo; said the Queen to the Lady Lochleven; &ldquo;we could not
      persuade you, our dearest hostess, that your household goods were in all
      safe keeping and surety. True it is, that we can excuse your anxiety,
      considering that these august apartments are so scantily furnished, that
      we have not been able to offer you even the relief of a stool during the
      long time you have afforded us the pleasure of your society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will, madam,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;the will to offer such accommodation
      was more wanting than the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Queen, looking round, and affecting surprise, &ldquo;there are
      then stools in this apartment&mdash;one, two&mdash;no less than four,
      including the broken one&mdash;a royal garniture!&mdash;We observed them
      not&mdash;will it please your ladyship to sit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, I will soon relieve you of my presence,&rdquo; replied the Lady
      Lochleven; &ldquo;and while with you, my aged limbs can still better brook
      fatigue, than my mind stoop to accept of constrained courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Lady of Lochleven, if you take it so deeply,&rdquo; said the Queen, rising
      and motioning to her own vacant chair, &ldquo;I would rather you assumed my seat&mdash;you
      are not the first of your family who has done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Lochleven curtsied a negative, but seemed with much difficulty
      to suppress the angry answer which rose to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this sharp conversation, the page's attention had been almost
      entirely occupied by the entrance of Catherine Seyton, who came from the
      inner apartment, in the usual dress in which she attended upon the Queen,
      and with nothing in her manner which marked either the hurry or confusion
      incident to a hasty change of disguise, or the conscious fear of detection
      in a perilous enterprise. Roland Graeme ventured to make her an obeisance
      as she entered, but she returned it with an air of the utmost
      indifference, which, in his opinion, was extremely inconsistent with the
      circumstances in which they stood towards each other.&mdash;&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he
      thought, &ldquo;she cannot in reason expect to bully me out of the belief due to
      mine own eyes, as she tried to do concerning the apparition in the
      hostelry of Saint Michael's&mdash;I will try if I cannot make her feel
      that this will be but a vain task, and that confidence in me is the wiser
      and safer course to pursue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts had passed rapidly through his mind, when the Queen, having
      finished her altercation with the Lady of the castle, again addressed him&mdash;&ldquo;What
      of the revels at Kinross, Roland Graeme? Methought they were gay, if I may
      judge from some faint sounds of mirth and distant music, which found their
      way so far as these grated windows, and died when they entered them, as
      all that is mirthful must&mdash;But thou lookest as sad as if thou hadst
      come from a conventicle of the Huguenots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so perchance he hath, madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady of Lochleven, at whom
      this side-shaft was lanched. &ldquo;I trust, amid yonder idle fooleries, there
      wanted not some pouring forth of doctrine to a better purpose than that
      vain mirth, which, blazing and vanishing like the crackling of dry thorns,
      leaves to the fools who love it nothing but dust and ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Fleming,&rdquo; said the Queen, turning round and drawing her mantle about
      her, &ldquo;I would that we had the chimney-grate supplied with a fagot or two
      of these same thorns which the Lady of Lochleven describes so well.
      Methinks the damp air from the lake, which stagnates in these vaulted
      rooms, renders them deadly cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace's pleasure shall be obeyed,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven; &ldquo;yet
      may I presume to remind you that we are now in summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the information, my good lady,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;for
      prisoners better learn their calender from the mouth of their jailor, than
      from any change they themselves feel in the seasons.&mdash;Once more,
      Roland Graeme, what of the revels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were gay, madam,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;but of the usual sort, and little
      worth your Highness's ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know not,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;how very indulgent my ear has become
      to all that speaks of freedom and the pleasures of the free. Methinks I
      would rather have seen the gay villagers dance their ring round the
      Maypole, than have witnessed the most stately masques within the precincts
      of a palace. The absence of stone-wall&mdash;the sense that the green turf
      is under the foot which may tread it free and unrestrained, is worth all
      that art or splendour can add to more courtly revels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven, addressing the page in her turn,
      &ldquo;there were amongst these follies none of the riots or disturbances to
      which they so naturally lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland gave a slight glance to Catherine Seyton, as if to bespeak her
      attention, as he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;I witnessed no offence, madam, worthy of
      marking&mdash;none indeed of any kind, save that a bold damsel made her
      hand somewhat too familiar with the cheek of a player-man, and ran some
      hazard of being ducked in the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these words he cast a hasty glance at Catherine; but she
      sustained, with the utmost serenity of manner and countenance, the hint
      which he had deemed could not have been thrown out before her without
      exciting some fear and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cumber your Grace no longer with my presence,&rdquo; said the Lady
      Lochleven, &ldquo;unless you have aught to command me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nought, our good hostess,&rdquo; answered the Queen, &ldquo;unless it be to pray you,
      that on another occasion you deem it not needful to postpone your better
      employment to wait so long upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please you,&rdquo; added the Lady Lochleven, &ldquo;to command this your
      gentleman to attend us, that I may receive some account of these matters
      which have been sent hither for your Grace's use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may not refuse what you are pleased to require, madam,&rdquo; answered the
      Queen. &ldquo;Go with the lady, Roland, if our commands be indeed necessary to
      thy doing so. We will hear to-morrow the history of thy Kinross pleasures.
      For this night we dismiss thy attendance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme went with the Lady of Lochleven, who failed not to ask him
      many questions concerning what had passed at the sports, to which he
      rendered such answers as were most likely to lull asleep any suspicions
      which she might entertain of his disposition to favour Queen Mary, taking
      especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition of Magdalen Graeme,
      and of the Abbot Ambrosius. At length, after undergoing a long and
      somewhat close examination, he was dismissed with such expressions, as,
      coming from the reserved and stern Lady of Lochleven, might seem to
      express a degree of favour and countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first care was to obtain some refreshment, which was more cheerfully
      afforded him by a good-natured pantler than by Dryfesdale, who was, on
      this occasion, much disposed to abide by the fashion of Pudding-burn
      House, where
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They who came not the first call.
  Gat no more meat till the next meal.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Roland Graeme had finished his repast, having his dismissal from the
      Queen for the evening, and being little inclined for such society as the
      castle afforded, he stole into the garden, in which he had permission to
      spend his leisure time, when it pleased him. In this place, the ingenuity
      of the contriver and disposer of the walks had exerted itself to make the
      most of little space, and by screens, both of stone ornamented with rude
      sculpture, and hedges of living green, had endeavoured to give as much
      intricacy and variety as the confined limits of the garden would admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the young man walked sadly, considering the events of the day, and
      comparing what had dropped from the Abbot with what he had himself noticed
      of the demeanour of George Douglas. &ldquo;It must be so,&rdquo; was the painful but
      inevitable conclusion at which he arrived. &ldquo;It must be by his aid that she
      is thus enabled, like a phantom, to transport herself from place to place,
      and to appear at pleasure on the mainland or on the islet.&mdash;It must
      be so,&rdquo; he repeated once more; &ldquo;with him she holds a close, secret, and
      intimate correspondence, altogether inconsistent with the eye of favour
      which she has sometimes cast upon me, and destructive to the hopes which
      she must have known these glances have necessarily inspired.&rdquo; And yet (for
      love will hope where reason despairs) the thought rushed on his mind, that
      it was possible she only encouraged Douglas's passion so far as might
      serve her mistress's interest, and that she was of too frank, noble, and
      candid a nature, to hold out to himself hopes which she meant not to
      fulfil. Lost in these various conjectures, he seated himself upon a bank
      of turf which commanded a view of the lake on the one side, and on the
      other of that front of the castle along which the Queen's apartments were
      situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had now for some time set, and the twilight of May was rapidly
      fading into a serene night. On the lake, the expanded water rose and fell,
      with the slightest and softest influence of a southern breeze, which
      scarcely dimpled the surface over which it passed. In the distance was
      still seen the dim outline of the island of Saint Serf, once visited by
      many a sandalled pilgrim, as the blessed spot trodden by a man of God&mdash;now
      neglected or violated, as the refuge of lazy priests, who had with justice
      been compelled to give place to the sheep and the heifers of a Protestant
      baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roland gazed on the dark speck, amid the lighter blue of the waters
      which surrounded it, the mazes of polemical discussion again stretched
      themselves before the eye of the mind. Had these men justly suffered their
      exile as licentious drones, the robbers, at once, and disgrace, of the
      busy hive? or had the hand of avarice and rapine expelled from the temple,
      not the ribalds who polluted, but the faithful priests who served the
      shrine in honour and fidelity? The arguments of Henderson, in this
      contemplative hour, rose with double force before him; and could scarcely
      be parried by the appeal which the Abbot Ambrosius had made from his
      understanding to his feelings,&mdash;an appeal which he had felt more
      forcibly amid the bustle of stirring life, than now when his reflections
      were more undisturbed. It required an effort to divert his mind from this
      embarrassing topic; and he found that he best succeeded by turning his
      eyes to the front of the tower, watching where a twinkling light still
      streamed from the casement of Catherine Seyton's apartment, obscured by
      times for a moment as the shadow of the fair inhabitant passed betwixt the
      taper and the window. At length the light was removed or extinguished, and
      that object of speculation was also withdrawn from the eyes of the
      meditative lover. Dare I confess the fact, without injuring his character
      for ever as a hero of romance? These eyes gradually became heavy;
      speculative doubts on the subject of religious controversy, and anxious
      conjectures concerning the state of his mistress's affections, became
      confusedly blended together in his musings; the fatigues of a busy day
      prevailed over the harassing subjects of contemplation which occupied his
      mind, and he fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound were his slumbers, until they were suddenly dispelled by the iron
      tongue of the castle-bell, which sent its deep and sullen sounds wide over
      the bosom of the lake, and awakened the echoes of Bennarty, the hill which
      descends steeply on its southern bank. Roland started up, for this bell
      was always tolled at ten o'clock, as the signal for locking the castle
      gates, and placing the keys under the charge of the seneschal. He
      therefore hastened to the wicket by which the garden communicated with the
      building, and had the mortification, just as he reached it, to hear the
      bolt leave its sheath with a discordant crash, and enter the stone groove
      of the door-lintel. &ldquo;Hold, hold,&rdquo; cried the page, &ldquo;and let me in ere you
      lock the wicket.&rdquo; The voice of Dryfesdale replied from within, in his
      usual tone of embittered sullenness, &ldquo;The hour is passed, fair master&mdash;you
      like not the inside of these walls&mdash;even make it a complete holiday,
      and spend the night as well as the day out of bounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant page, &ldquo;or by Saint Giles I will
      make thy gold chain smoke for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no alarm here,&rdquo; retorted the impenetrable Dryfesdale, &ldquo;but keep thy
      sinful oaths and silly threats for those that regard them&mdash;I do mine
      office, and carry the keys to the seneschal.&mdash;Adieu, my young master!
      the cool night air will advantage your hot blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward was right in what he said; for the cooling breeze was very
      necessary to appease the feverish fit of anger which Roland experienced,
      nor did the remedy succeed for some time. At length, after some hasty
      turns made through the garden, exhausting his passion in vain vows of
      vengeance, Roland Graeme began to be sensible that his situation ought
      rather to be held as matter of laughter than of serious resentment. To one
      bred a sportsman, a night spent in the open air had in it little of
      hardship, and the poor malice of the steward seemed more worthy of his
      contempt than his anger. &ldquo;I would to God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the grim old man
      may always have contented himself with such sportive revenge. He often
      looks as he were capable of doing us a darker turn.&rdquo; Returning, therefore,
      to the turf-seat which he had formerly occupied, and which was partially
      sheltered by a trim fence of green holly, he drew his mantle around him,
      stretched himself at length on the verdant settle, and endeavoured to
      resume that sleep which the castle bell had interrupted to so little
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep, like other earthly blessings, is niggard of its favours when most
      courted. The more Roland invoked her aid, the farther she fled from his
      eyelids. He had been completely awakened, first, by the sounds of the
      bell, and then by his own aroused vivacity of temper, and he found it
      difficult again to compose himself to slumber. At length, when his mind&mdash;was
      wearied out with a maze of unpleasing meditation, he succeeded in coaxing
      himself into a broken slumber. This was again dispelled by the voices of
      two persons who were walking in the garden, the sound of whose
      conversation, after mingling for some time in the page's dreams, at length
      succeeded in awaking him thoroughly. He raised himself from his reclining
      posture in the utmost astonishment, which the circumstance of hearing two
      persons at that late hour conversing on the outside of the watchfully
      guarded Castle of Lochloven, was so well calculated to excite. His first
      thought was of supernatural beings; his next, upon some attempt on the
      part of Queen Mary's friends and followers; his last was, that George of
      Douglas, possessed of the keys, and having the means of ingress and egress
      at pleasure, was availing himself of his office to hold a rendezvous with
      Catherine Seyton in the castle garden. He was confirmed in this opinion by
      the tone of the voice, which asked in a low whisper, &ldquo;whether all was
      ready?&rdquo;

      Chapter the Thirtieth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent,
  Like war's swart powder in a castle vault,
  Until occasion, like the linstock, lights it:
  Then comes at once the lightning&mdash;and the thunder,
  And distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder.
                                 OLD PLAY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme, availing himself of a breach in the holly screen, and of
      the assistance of the full moon, which was now arisen, had a perfect
      opportunity, himself unobserved, to reconnoitre the persons and the
      motions of those by whom his rest had been thus unexpectedly disturbed;
      and his observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions. They stood
      together in close and earnest conversation within four yards of the place
      of his retreat, and he could easily recognize the tall form and deep voice
      of Douglas, and the no less remarkable dress and tone of the page at the
      hostelry of Saint Michael's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been at the door of the page's apartment,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;but he
      is not there, or he will not answer. It is fast bolted on the inside, as
      is the custom, and we cannot pass through it&mdash;and what his silence
      may bode I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have trusted him too far,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;a feather-headed
      cox-comb, upon whose changeable mind and hot brain there is no making an
      abiding impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not I who was willing to trust him,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;but I was
      assured he would prove friendly when called upon&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Here he spoke so low that Roland lost the tenor of his words, which was
      the more provoking, as he was fully aware that he was himself the subject
      of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the stranger, more aloud, &ldquo;I have on my side put him off
      with fair words, which make fools vain&mdash;but now, if you distrust him
      at the push, deal with him with your dagger, and so make open passage.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0542}.jpg" alt="{0542}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0542}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;That were too rash,&rdquo; said Douglas; &ldquo;and besides, as I told you, the door
      of his apartment is shut and bolted. I will essay again to waken him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Graeme instantly comprehended, that the ladies, having been somehow made
      aware of his being in the garden, had secured the door of the outer room
      in which he usually slept, as a sort of sentinel upon that only access to
      the Queen's apartments. But then, how came Catherine Seyton to be abroad,
      if the Queen and the other lady were still within their chambers, and the
      access to them locked and bolted?&mdash;&ldquo;I will be instantly at the bottom
      of these mysteries,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then thank Mistress Catherine, if this
      be really she, for the kind use which she exhorted Douglas to make of his
      dagger&mdash;they seek me, as I comprehend, and they shall not seek me in
      vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Douglas had by this time re-entered the castle by the wicket, which was
      now open. The stranger stood alone in the garden walk, his arms folded on
      his breast, and his eyes cast impatiently up to the moon, as if accusing
      her of betraying him by the magnificence of her lustre. In a moment Roland
      Graeme stood before him&mdash;&ldquo;A goodly night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mistress
      Catherine, for a young lady to stray forth in disguise, and to meet with
      men in an orchard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the stranger page, &ldquo;hush, thou foolish patch, and tell us in
      a word if thou art friend or foe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I be friend to one who deceives me by fair words, and who
      would have Douglas deal with me with his poniard?&rdquo; replied Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fiend receive George of Douglas and thee too, thou born madcap and
      sworn marplot!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;we shall be discovered, and then death is
      the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;you have dealt falsely and cruelly with me,
      and the moment of explanation is now come&mdash;neither it nor you shall
      escape me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madman!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I am neither Kate nor Catherine&mdash;the
      moon shines bright enough surely to know the hart from the hind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shift shall not serve you, fair mistress,&rdquo; said the page, laying
      hold on the lap of the stranger's cloak; &ldquo;this time, at least, I will know
      with whom I deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhand me,&rdquo; said she, endeavouring to extricate herself from his grasp;
      and in a tone where anger seemed to contend with a desire to laugh, &ldquo;use
      you so little discretion towards a daughter of Seyton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as Roland, encouraged perhaps by her risibility to suppose his
      violence was not unpardonably offensive, kept hold on her mantle, she
      said, in a sterner tone of unmixed resentment,&mdash;&ldquo;Madman! let me go!&mdash;there
      is life and death in this moment&mdash;I would not willingly hurt thee,
      and yet beware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she made a sudden effort to escape, and, in doing so, a
      pistol, which she carried in her hand or about her person, went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      This warlike sound instantly awakened the well-warded castle. The warder
      blew his horn, and began to toll the castle bell, crying out at the same
      time, &ldquo;Fie, treason! treason! cry all! cry all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apparition of Catherine Seyton, which the page had let loose in the
      first moment of astonishment, vanished in darkness; but the plash of oars
      was heard, and, in a second or two, five or six harquebuses and a falconet
      were fired from the battlements of the castle successively, as if levelled
      at some object on the water. Confounded with these incidents, no way for
      Catherine's protection (supposing her to be in the boat which he had heard
      put from the shore) occurred to Roland, save to have recourse to George of
      Douglas. He hastened for this purpose towards the apartment of the Queen,
      whence he heard loud voices and much trampling of feet. When he entered,
      he found himself added to a confused and astonished group, which,
      assembled in that apartment, stood gazing upon each other. At the upper
      end of the room stood the Queen, equipped as for a journey, and&mdash;attended
      not only by the Lady Fleming, but by the omnipresent Catherine Seyton,
      dressed in the habit of her own sex, and bearing in her hand the casket in
      which Mary kept such jewels as she had been permitted to retain. At the
      other end of the hall was the Lady of Lochleven, hastily dressed, as one
      startled from slumber by the sudden alarm, and surrounded by domestics,
      some bearing torches, others holding naked swords, partisans, pistols, or
      such other weapons as they had caught up in the hurry of a night alarm.
      Betwixt these two parties stood George of Douglas, his arms folded on his
      breast, his eyes bent on the ground, like a criminal who knows not how to
      deny, yet continues unwilling to avow, the guilt in which he has been
      detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, George of Douglas,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven; &ldquo;speak, and clear
      the horrid suspicion which rests on thy name. Say, 'A Douglas was never
      faithless to his trust, and I am a Douglas.' Say this, my dearest son, and
      it is all I ask thee to say to clear thy name, even under, such a foul
      charge. Say it was but the wile of these unhappy women, and this false
      boy, which plotted an escape so fatal to Scotland&mdash;so destructive to
      thy father's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said old Dryfesdale the steward, &ldquo;this much do I say for this
      silly page, that he could not be accessary to unlocking the doors, since I
      myself this night bolted him out of the castle. Whoever limned this
      night-piece, the lad's share in it seems to have been small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou liest, Dryfesdale,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;and wouldst throw the blame on
      thy master's house, to save the worthless life of a gipsy boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His death were more desirable to me than his life,&rdquo; answered the steward,
      sullenly; &ldquo;but the truth is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Douglas raised his head, drew up his figure to its full
      height, and spoke boldly and sedately, as one whose resolution was taken.
      &ldquo;Let no life be endangered for me. I alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Douglas,&rdquo; said the Queen, interrupting him, &ldquo;art thou mad? Speak not, I
      charge you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he replied, bowing with the deepest respect, &ldquo;gladly would I obey
      your commands, but they must have a victim, and let it be the true one.&mdash;Yes,
      madam,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;I alone am guilty
      in this matter. If the word of a Douglas has yet any weight with you,
      believe me that this boy is innocent; and on your conscience I charge you,
      do him no wrong; nor let the Queen suffer hardship for embracing the
      opportunity of freedom which sincere loyalty&mdash;which a sentiment yet
      deeper&mdash;offered to her acceptance. Yes! I had planned the escape of
      the most beautiful, the most persecuted of women; and far from regretting
      that I, for a while, deceived the malice of her enemies, I glory in it,
      and am most willing to yield up life itself in her cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now may God have compassion on my age,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;and
      enable me to bear this load of affliction! O Princess, born in a luckless
      hour, when will you cease to be the instrument of seduction and of ruin to
      all who approach you? O ancient house of Lochleven, famed so long for
      birth and honour, evil was the hour which brought the deceiver under thy
      roof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say not so, madam,&rdquo; replied her grandson; &ldquo;the old honours of the Douglas
      line will be outshone, when one of its descendants dies for the most
      injured of queens&mdash;for the most lovely of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Douglas,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;must I at this moment&mdash;ay, even at this
      moment, when I may lose a faithful subject for ever, chide thee for
      forgetting what is due to me as thy Queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched boy,&rdquo; said the distracted Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;hast thou fallen
      even thus far into the snare of this Moabitish woman?&mdash;hast thou
      bartered thy name, thy allegiance, thy knightly oath, thy duty to thy
      parents, thy country, and thy God, for a feigned tear, or a sickly smile,
      from lips which flattered the infirm Francis&mdash;lured to death the
      idiot Darnley&mdash;read luscious poetry with the minion Chastelar&mdash;mingled
      in the lays of love which were sung by the beggar Rizzio&mdash;and which
      were joined in rapture to those of the foul and licentious Bothwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaspheme not, madam!&rdquo; said Douglas;&mdash;&ldquo;nor you, fair Queen, and
      virtuous as fair, chide at this moment the presumption of thy vassal!&mdash;Think
      not that the mere devotion of a subject could have moved me to the part I
      have been performing. Well you deserve that each of your lieges should die
      for you; but I have done more&mdash;have done that to which love alone
      could compel a Douglas&mdash;I have dissembled. Farewell, then, Queen of
      all hearts, and Empress of that of Douglas!&mdash;When you are freed from
      this vile bondage&mdash;as freed you shall be, if justice remains in
      Heaven&mdash;and when you load with honours and titles the happy man who
      shall deliver you, cast one thought on him whose heart would have despised
      every reward for a kiss of your hand&mdash;cast one thought on his
      fidelity, and drop one tear on his grave.&rdquo; And throwing himself at her
      feet, he seized her hand, and pressed it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This before my face!&rdquo; exclaimed the Lady of Lochleven&mdash;&ldquo;wilt thou
      court thy adulterous paramour before the eyes of a parent?&mdash;Tear them
      asunder, and put him under strict ward! Seize him, upon your lives!&rdquo; she
      added, seeing that her attendants looked at each other with hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are doubtful,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Save thyself, Douglas, I command thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started up from the floor, and only exclaiming, &ldquo;My life or death are
      yours, and at your disposal!&rdquo;&mdash;drew his sword, and broke through
      those who stood betwixt him and the door. The enthusiasm of his onset was
      too sudden and too lively to have been opposed by any thing short of the
      most decided opposition; and as he was both loved and feared by his
      father's vassals, none of them would offer him actual injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Lochleven stood astonished at his sudden escape&mdash;&ldquo;Am I
      surrounded,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;by traitors? Upon him, villains!&mdash;pursue,
      stab, cut him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot leave the island, madam,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale, interfering; &ldquo;I have
      the key of the boat-chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But two or three voices of those who pursued from curiosity, or command of
      their mistress, exclaimed from below, that he had cast himself into the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave Douglas still!&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, true and noble
      heart, that prefers death to imprisonment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire upon him!&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven; &ldquo;if there be here a true
      servant of his father, let him shoot the runagate dead, and let the lake
      cover our shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The report of a gun or two was heard, but they were probably shot rather
      to obey the Lady, than with any purpose of hitting the mark; and Randal
      immediately entering, said that Master George had been taken up by a boat
      from the castle, which lay at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man a barge, and pursue them!&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were quite vain,&rdquo; said Randal; &ldquo;by this time they are half way to
      shore, and a cloud has come over the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has the traitor then escaped?&rdquo; said the Lady, pressing her hands
      against her forehead with a gesture of despair; &ldquo;the honour of our house
      is for ever gone, and all will be deemed accomplices in this base
      treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady of Lochleven,&rdquo; said Mary, advancing towards her, &ldquo;you have this
      night cut off my fairest hopes&mdash;You have turned my expected freedom
      into bondage, and dashed away the cup of joy in the very instant I was
      advancing it to my lips&mdash;and yet I feel for your sorrow the pity that
      you deny to mine&mdash;Gladly would I comfort you if I might; but as I may
      not, I would at least part from you in charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, proud woman!&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;who ever knew so well as thou to deal
      the deepest wounds under the pretence of kindness and courtesy?&mdash;Who,
      since the great traitor, could ever so betray with a kiss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Douglas of Lochleven,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;in this moment thou canst
      not offend me&mdash;no, not even by thy coarse and unwomanly language,
      held to me in the presence of menials and armed retainers. I have this
      night owed so much to one member of the house of Lochleven, as to cancel
      whatever its mistress can do or say in the wildness of her passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are bounden to you, Princess,&rdquo; said Lady Lochleven, putting a strong
      constraint on herself, and passing from her tone of violence to that of
      bitter irony; &ldquo;our poor house hath been but seldom graced with royal
      smiles, and will hardly, with my choice, exchange their rough honesty for
      such court-honour as Mary of Scotland has now to bestow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They,&rdquo; replied Mary, &ldquo;who knew so well how to <i>take</i>, may think
      themselves excused from the obligation implied in receiving. And that I
      have now little to offer, is the fault of the Douglasses and their
      allies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady of Lochleven, in the same bitter
      tone, &ldquo;you retain an exchequer which neither your own prodigality can
      drain, nor your offended country deprive you of. While you have fair words
      and delusive smiles at command, you need no other bribes to lure youth to
      folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen cast not an ungratified glance on a large mirror, which, hanging
      on one side of the apartment, and illuminated by the torch-light,
      reflected her beautiful face and person. &ldquo;Our hostess grows complaisant,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;my Fleming; we had not thought that grief and captivity had
      left us so well stored with that sort of wealth which ladies prize most
      dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace will drive this severe woman frantic,&rdquo; said Fleming, in a low
      tone. &ldquo;On my knees I implore you to remember she is already dreadfully
      offended, and that we are in her power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not spare her, Fleming,&rdquo; answered the Queen; &ldquo;it is against my
      nature. She returned my honest sympathy with insult and abuse, and I will
      gall her in return,&mdash;if her words are too blunt for answer, let her
      use her poniard if she dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Lochleven,&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming aloud, &ldquo;would surely do well
      now to withdraw, and to leave her Grace to repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Lady, &ldquo;or to leave her Grace, and her Grace's minions,
      to think what silly fly they may next wrap their meshes about. My eldest
      son is a widower&mdash;were he not more worthy the flattering hopes with
      which you have seduced his brother?&mdash;True, the yoke of marriage has
      been already thrice fitted on&mdash;but the church of Rome calls it a
      sacrament, and its votaries may deem it one in which they cannot too often
      participate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the votaries of the church of Geneva,&rdquo; replied Mary, colouring with
      indignation, &ldquo;as they deem marriage <i>no</i> sacrament, are said at times
      to dispense with the holy ceremony.&rdquo;&mdash;Then, as if afraid of the
      consequences of this home allusion to the errors of Lady Lochleven's early
      life, the Queen added, &ldquo;Come, my Fleming, we grace her too much by this
      altercation; we will to our sleeping apartment. If she would disturb us
      again to-night, she must cause the door to be forced.&rdquo; So saying, she
      retired to her bed-room, followed by her two women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lochleven, stunned as it were by this last sarcasm, and not the less
      deeply incensed that she had drawn it upon herself, remained like a statue
      on the spot which she had occupied when she received an affront so
      flagrant. Dryfesdale and Randal endeavoured to rouse her to recollection
      by questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your honourable Ladyship's pleasure in the premises?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we not double the sentinels, and place one upon the boats and
      another in the garden?&rdquo; said Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you that despatches were sent to Sir William at Edinburgh, to
      acquaint him with what has happened?&rdquo; demanded Dryfesdale; &ldquo;and ought not
      the place of Kinross to be alarmed, lest there be force upon the shores of
      the lake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all as thou wilt,&rdquo; said the Lady, collecting herself, and about to
      depart. &ldquo;Thou hast the name of a good soldier, Dryfesdale, take all
      precautions.&mdash;Sacred Heaven! that I should be thus openly insulted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be your pleasure,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale, hesitating, &ldquo;that this
      person&mdash;this Lady&mdash;be more severely restrained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, vassal!&rdquo; answered the Lady, indignantly, &ldquo;my revenge stoops not to so
      low a gratification. But I will have more worthy vengeance, or the tomb of
      my ancestors shall cover my shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you shall have it, madam,&rdquo; replied Dryfesdale&mdash;&ldquo;ere two suns go
      down, you shall term yourself amply revenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady made no answer&mdash;perhaps did not hear his words, as she
      presently left the apartment. By the command of Dryfesdale, the rest of
      the attendants were dismissed, some to do the duty of guard, others to
      their repose. The steward himself remained after they had all departed;
      and Roland Graeme, who was alone in the apartment, was surprised to see
      the old soldier advance towards him with an air of greater cordiality than
      he had ever before assumed to him, but which sat ill on his scowling
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have done thee some wrong&mdash;it is thine own
      fault, for thy behaviour hath seemed as light to me as the feather thou
      wearest in thy hat; and surely thy fantastic apparel, and idle humour of
      mirth and folly, have made me construe thee something harshly. But I saw
      this night from my casement, (as I looked out to see how thou hadst
      disposed of thyself in the garden,) I saw, I say, the true efforts which
      thou didst make to detain the companion of the perfidy of him who is no
      longer worthy to be called by his father's name, but must be cut off from
      his house like a rotten branch. I was just about to come to thy assistance
      when the pistol went off; and the warder (a false knave, whom I suspect to
      be bribed for the nonce) saw himself forced to give the alarm, which,
      perchance, till then he had wilfully withheld. To atone, therefore, for my
      injustice towards you, I would willingly render you a courtesy, if you
      would accept of it from my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I first crave to know what it is?&rdquo; replied the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply to carry the news of this discovery to Holyrood, where thou mayest
      do thyself much grace, as well with the Earl of Morton and the Regent
      himself, as with Sir William Douglas, seeing thou hast seen the matter
      from end to end, and borne faithful part therein. The making thine own
      fortune will be thus lodged in thine own hand, when I trust thou wilt
      estrange thyself from foolish vanities, and learn to walk in this world as
      one who thinks upon the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Steward,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;I thank you for your courtesy, but I
      may not do your errand. I pass that I am the Queen's sworn servant, and
      may not be of counsel against her. But, setting this apart, methinks it
      were a bad road to Sir William of Lochleven's favour, to be the first to
      tell him of his son's defection&mdash;neither would the Regent be over
      well pleased to hear the infidelity of his vassal, nor Morton to learn the
      falsehood of his kinsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said the steward, making that inarticulate sound which expresses
      surprise mingled with displeasure. &ldquo;Nay, then, even fly where ye list;
      for, giddy-pated as ye may be, you know how to bear you in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you my esteem is less selfish than ye think for,&rdquo; said the
      page; &ldquo;for I hold truth and mirth to be better than gravity and cunning&mdash;ay,
      and in the end to be a match for them.&mdash;You never loved me less, Sir
      Steward, than you do at this moment. I know you will give me no real
      confidence, and I am resolved to accept no false protestations as current
      coin. Resume your old course&mdash;suspect me as much and watch me as
      closely as you will, I bid you defiance&mdash;you have met with your
      match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, young man,&rdquo; said the steward, with a look of bitter malignity,
      &ldquo;if thou darest to attempt any treachery towards the House of Lochleven,
      thy head shall blacken in the sun from the warder's turret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot commit treachery who refuses trust,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;and for my
      head, it stands as securely on my shoulders, as on any turret that ever
      mason built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, thou prating and speckled pie,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale, &ldquo;that art so
      vain of thine idle tongue and variegated coat! Beware trap and lime-twig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fare thee well, thou hoarse old raven,&rdquo; answered the page; &ldquo;thy
      solemn flight, sable hue, and deep croak, are no charms against bird-bolt
      or hail-shot, and that thou mayst find&mdash;it is open war betwixt us,
      each for the cause of our mistress, and God show the right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, and defend his own people!&rdquo; said the steward. &ldquo;I will let my
      mistress know what addition thou hast made to this mess of traitors. Good
      night, Monsieur Featherpate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Seignior Sowersby,&rdquo; replied the page; and, when the old man
      departed, he betook himself to rest.

  Poison'd&mdash;ill fare!&mdash;dead, forsook, cast off!&mdash;
                                  KING JOHN.
</pre>
    <p>
      However weary Roland Graeme might be of the Castle of Lochleven&mdash;however
      much he might wish that the plan for Mary's escape had been perfected, I
      question if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings than on the morning
      after George Douglas's plan for accomplishing her deliverance had been
      frustrated. In the first place, he had the clearest conviction that he had
      misunderstood the innuendo of the Abbot, and that the affections of
      Douglas were fixed, not on Catherine Seyton, but on the Queen; and in the
      second place, from the sort of explanation which had taken place betwixt
      the steward and him, he felt himself at liberty, without any breach of
      honour towards the family of Lochleven, to contribute his best aid to any
      scheme which should in future be formed for the Queen's escape; and,
      independently of the good-will which he himself had to the enterprise, he
      knew he could find no surer road to the favour of Catherine Seyton. He now
      sought but an opportunity to inform her that he had dedicated himself to
      this task, and fortune was propitious in affording him one which was
      unusually favourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the ordinary hour of breakfast, it was introduced by the steward with
      his usual forms, who, as soon as it was placed on the board in the inner
      apartment, said to Roland Graeme, with a glance of sarcastic import, &ldquo;I
      leave you, my young sir, to do the office of sewer&mdash;it has been too
      long rendered to the Lady Mary by one belonging to the house of Douglas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it the prime and principal who ever bore the name,&rdquo; said Roland,
      &ldquo;the office were an honour to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward departed without replying to this bravade, otherwise than by a
      dark look of scorn. Graeme, thus left alone, busied himself as one engaged
      in a labour of love, to imitate, as well as he could, the grace and
      courtesy with which George of Douglas was wont to render his ceremonial
      service at meals to the Queen of Scotland. There was more than youthful
      vanity&mdash;there was a generous devotion in the feeling with which he
      took up the task, as a brave soldier assumes the place of a comrade who
      has fallen in the front of battle. &ldquo;I am now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;their only
      champion: and, come weal, come wo, I will be, to the best of my skill and
      power, as faithful, as trustworthy, as brave, as any Douglas of them all
      could have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Catherine Seyton entered alone, contrary to her custom; and
      not less contrary to her custom, she entered with her kerchief at her
      eyes. Roland Graeme approached her with beating heart and with down-cast
      eyes, and asked her, in a low and hesitating voice, whether the Queen were
      well?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you suppose it?&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;Think you her heart and body are
      framed of steel and iron, to endure the cruel disappointment of yester
      even, and the infamous taunts of yonder puritanic hag?&mdash;Would to God
      that I were a man, to aid her more effectually!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those who carry pistols, and batons, and poniards,&rdquo; said the page,
      &ldquo;are not men, they are at least Amazons; and that is as formidable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to the flash of your wit, sir,&rdquo; replied the damsel; &ldquo;I am
      neither in spirits to enjoy, nor to reply to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;list to me in all serious truth. And, first,
      let me say, that the gear last night had been smoother, had you taken me
      into your counsels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so we meant; but who could have guessed that Master Page should
      choose to pass all night in the garden, like some moon-stricken knight in
      a Spanish romance&mdash;instead of being in his bed-room, when Douglas
      came to hold communication with him on our project.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;defer to so late a moment so important a
      confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your communications with Henderson, and&mdash;with pardon&mdash;the
      natural impetuosity and fickleness of your disposition, made us dread to
      entrust you with a secret of such consequence, till the last moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why at the last moment?&rdquo; said the page, offended at this frank
      avowal; &ldquo;why at that, or any other moment, since I had the misfortune to
      incur so much suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay&mdash;now you are angry again,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;and to serve you
      aright I should break off this talk; but I will be magnanimous, and answer
      your question. Know, then, our reason for trusting you was twofold. In the
      first place, we could scarce avoid it, since you slept in the room through
      which we had to pass. In the second place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;you may dispense with a second reason, when the
      first makes your confidence in me a case of necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good now, hold thy peace,&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;In the second place, as I
      said before, there is one foolish person among us, who believes that
      Roland Graeme's heart is warm, though his head is giddy&mdash;that his
      blood is pure, though it boils too hastily&mdash;and that his faith and
      honour are true as the load-star, though his tongue sometimes is far less
      than discreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This avowal Catherine repeated in a low tone, with her eye fixed on the
      floor, as if she shunned the glance of Roland while she suffered it to
      escape her lips&mdash;&ldquo;And this single friend,&rdquo; exclaimed the youth in
      rapture; &ldquo;this only one who would do justice to the poor Roland Graeme,
      and whose own generous heart taught her to distinguish between follies of
      the brain and faults of the heart&mdash;Will you not tell me, dearest
      Catherine, to whom I owe my most grateful, my most heartfelt thanks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Catherine, with her eyes still fixed on the ground, &ldquo;if your
      own heart tell you not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Catherine!&rdquo; said the page, seizing upon her hand, and kneeling on
      one knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your own heart, I say, tell you not,&rdquo; said Catherine, gently
      disengaging her hand, &ldquo;it is very ungrateful; for since the maternal
      kindness of the Lady Fleming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page started on his feet. &ldquo;By Heaven, Catherine, your tongue wears as
      many disguises as your person! But you only mock me, cruel girl. You know
      the Lady Fleming has no more regard for any one, than hath the forlorn
      princess who is wrought into yonder piece of old figured court tapestry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton, &ldquo;but you should not speak so loud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered the page, but at the same time lowering his voice, &ldquo;she
      cares for no one but herself and the Queen. And you know, besides, there
      is no one of you whose opinion I value, if I have not your own. No&mdash;not
      that of Queen Mary herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more shame for you, if it be so,&rdquo; said Catherine, with great
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, fair Catherine,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;why will you thus damp my
      ardour, when I am devoting myself, body and soul, to the cause of your
      mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because in doing so,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;you debase a cause so noble,
      by naming along with it any lower or more selfish motive. Believe me,&rdquo; she
      said, with kindling eyes, and while the blood mantled on her cheek, &ldquo;they
      think vilely and falsely of women&mdash;I mean of those who deserve the
      name&mdash;who deem that they love the gratification of their vanity, or
      the mean purpose of engrossing a lover's admiration and affection, better
      than they love the virtue and honour of the man they may be brought to
      prefer. He that serves his religion, his prince, and his country, with
      ardour and devotion, need not plead his cause with the commonplace rant of
      romantic passion&mdash;the woman whom he honours with his love becomes his
      debtor, and her corresponding affection is engaged to repay his glorious
      toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold a glorious prize for such toil,&rdquo; said the youth, bending his
      eyes on her with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a heart which knows how to value it,&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;He that
      should free this injured Princess from these dungeons, and set her at
      liberty among her loyal and warlike nobles, whose hearts are burning to
      welcome her&mdash;where is the maiden in Scotland whom the love of such a
      hero would not honour, were she sprung from the blood royal of the land,
      and he the offspring of the poorest cottager that ever held a plough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am determined,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;to take the adventure. Tell me first,
      however, fair Catherine, and speak it as if you were confessing to the
      priest&mdash;this poor Queen, I know she is unhappy&mdash;but, Catherine,
      do you hold her innocent? She is accused of murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I hold the lamb guilty, because it is assailed by the wolf?&rdquo; answered
      Catherine; &ldquo;do I hold yonder sun polluted, because an earth-damp sullies
      his beams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The page sighed and looked down. &ldquo;Would my conviction were as deep as
      thine! But one thing is clear, that in this captivity she hath wrong&mdash;She
      rendered herself up, on a capitulation, and the terms have been refused
      her&mdash;I will embrace her quarrel to the death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&mdash;will you, indeed?&rdquo; said Catherine, taking his hand in her
      turn. &ldquo;Oh, be but firm in mind, as thou art bold in deed and quick in
      resolution; keep but thy plighted faith, and after ages shall honour thee
      as the saviour of Scotland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I have toiled successfully to win that Leah, Honour, thou wilt
      not, my Catherine,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;condemn me to a new term of service
      for that Rachel, Love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that,&rdquo; said Catherine, again extricating her hand from his grasp, &ldquo;we
      shall have full time to speak; but Honour is the elder sister, and must be
      won the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not win her,&rdquo; answered the page; &ldquo;but I will venture fairly for
      her, and man can do no more. And know, fair Catherine,&mdash;for you shall
      see the very secret thought of my heart,&mdash;that not Honour only&mdash;not
      only that other and fairer sister, whom you frown on me for so much as
      mentioning&mdash;but the stern commands of duty also, compel me to aid the
      Queen's deliverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;you were wont to have doubts on that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but her life was not then threatened,&rdquo; replied Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it now more endangered than heretofore?&rdquo; asked Catherine Seyton,
      in anxious terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not alarmed,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;but you heard the terms on which your
      royal mistress parted with the Lady of Lochleven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too well&mdash;but too well,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;alas! that she cannot rule
      her princely resentment, and refrain from encounters like these!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hath passed betwixt them,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;for which woman never
      forgives woman. I saw the Lady's brow turn pale, and then black, when,
      before all the menzie, and in her moment of power, the Queen humbled her
      to the dust by taxing her with her shame. And I heard the oath of deadly
      resentment and revenge which she muttered in the ear of one, who by his
      answer will, I judge, be but too ready an executioner of her will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You terrify me,&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not so take it&mdash;call up the masculine part of your spirit&mdash;we
      will counteract and defeat her plans, be they dangerous as they may. Why
      do you look upon me thus, and weep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;because you stand there before me a living and
      breathing man, in all the adventurous glow and enterprise of youth, yet
      still possessing the frolic spirits of childhood&mdash;there you stand,
      full alike of generous enterprise and childish recklessness; and if
      to-day, or to-morrow, or some such brief space, you lie a mangled and
      lifeless corpse upon the floor of these hateful dungeons, who but
      Catherine Seyton will be the cause of your brave and gay career being
      broken short as you start from the goal? Alas! she whom you have chosen to
      twine your wreath, may too probably have to work your shroud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be it so, Catherine,&rdquo; said the page, in the full glow of youthful
      enthusiasm; &ldquo;and <i>do</i> thou work my shroud! and if thou grace it with
      such tears as fall now at the thought, it will honour my remains more than
      an earl's mantle would my living body. But shame on this faintness of
      heart! the time craves a firmer mood&mdash;Be a woman, Catherine, or
      rather be a man&mdash;thou canst be a man if thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine dried her tears, and endeavoured to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not ask me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;about that which so much disturbs your
      mind; you shall know all in time&mdash;nay, you should know all now, but
      that&mdash;Hush! here comes the Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary entered from her apartment, paler than usual, and apparently
      exhausted by a sleepless night, and by the painful thoughts which had ill
      supplied the place of repose; yet the languor of her looks was so far from
      impairing her beauty, that it only substituted the frail delicacy of the
      lovely woman for the majestic grace of the Queen. Contrary to her wont,
      her toilette had been very hastily despatched, and her hair, which was
      usually dressed by Lady Fleming with great care, escaping from beneath the
      headtire, which had been hastily adjusted, fell in long and luxuriant
      tresses of Nature's own curling, over a neck and bosom which were somewhat
      less carefully veiled than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stepped over the threshold of her apartment, Catherine, hastily
      drying her tears, ran to meet her royal mistress, and having first kneeled
      at her feet, and kissed her hand, instantly rose, and placing herself on
      the other side of the Queen, seemed anxious to divide with the Lady
      Fleming the honour of supporting and assisting her. The page, on his part,
      advanced and put in order the chair of state, which she usually occupied,
      and having placed the cushion and footstool for her accommodation, stepped
      back, and stood ready for service in the place usually occupied by his
      predecessor, the young Seneschal. Mary's eye rested an instant on him, and
      could not but remark the change of persons. Hers was not the female heart
      which could refuse compassion, at least, to a gallant youth who had
      suffered in her cause, although he had been guided in his enterprise by a
      too presumptuous passion; and the words &ldquo;Poor Douglas!&rdquo; escaped from her
      lips, perhaps unconsciously, as she leant herself back in her chair, and
      put the kerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gracious madam,&rdquo; said Catherine, assuming a cheerful manner, in
      order to cheer her sovereign, &ldquo;our gallant Knight is indeed banished&mdash;the
      adventure was not reserved for him; but he has left behind him a youthful
      Esquire, as much devoted to your Grace's service, and who, by me, makes
      you tender of his hand and sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they may in aught avail your Grace,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, bowing
      profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;what needs this, Catherine?&mdash;why prepare new
      victims to be involved in, and overwhelmed by, my cruel fortune?&mdash;were
      we not better cease to struggle, and ourselves sink in the tide without
      farther resistance, than thus drag into destruction with us every generous
      heart which makes an effort in our favour?&mdash;I have had but too much
      of plot and intrigue around me, since I was stretched an orphan child in
      my very cradle, while contending nobles strove which should rule in the
      name of the unconscious innocent. Surely time it were that all this busy
      and most dangerous coil should end. Let me call my prison a convent, and
      my seclusion a voluntary sequestration of myself from the world and its
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak not thus, madam, before your faithful servants,&rdquo; said Catherine,
      &ldquo;to discourage their zeal at once, and to break their hearts. Daughter of
      Kings, be not in this hour so unkingly&mdash;Come, Roland, and let us, the
      youngest of her followers, show ourselves worthy of her cause&mdash;let us
      kneel before her footstool, and implore her to be her own magnanimous
      self.&rdquo; And leading Roland Graeme to the Queen's seat, they both kneeled
      down before her. Mary raised herself in her chair, and sat erect, while,
      extending one hand to be kissed by the page, she arranged with the other
      the clustering locks which shaded the bold yet lovely brow of the
      high-spirited Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! <i>ma mignóne</i>,&rdquo; she said, for so in fondness she often called
      her young attendant, &ldquo;that you should thus desperately mix with my unhappy
      fate the fortune of your young lives!&mdash;Are they not a lovely couple,
      my Fleming? and is it not heart-rending to think that I must be their
      ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, &ldquo;it is we, gracious Sovereign, who will be
      your deliverers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ex oribus parvulorum!</i>&rdquo; said the Queen, looking upward; &ldquo;if it is
      by the mouth of these children that Heaven calls me to resume the stately
      thoughts which become my birth and my rights, thou wilt grant them thy
      protection, and to me the power of rewarding their zeal!&rdquo;&mdash;Then
      turning to Fleming, she instantly added,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou knowest, my friend,
      whether to make those who have served me happy, was not ever Mary's
      favourite pastime. When I have been rebuked by the stern preachers of the
      Calvinistic heresy&mdash;when I have seen the fierce countenances of my
      nobles averted from me, has it not been because I mixed in the harmless
      pleasures of the young and gay, and rather for the sake of their happiness
      than my own, have mingled in the masque, the song, or the dance, with the
      youth of my household? Well, I repent not of it&mdash;though Knox termed
      it sin, and Morton degradation&mdash;I was happy, because I saw happiness
      around me; and woe betide the wretched jealousy that can extract guilt out
      of the overflowings of an unguarded gaiety!&mdash;Fleming, if we are
      restored to our throne, shall we not have one blithesome day at a
      blithesome bridal, of which we must now name neither the bride nor the
      bridegroom? but that bridegroom shall have the barony of Blairgowrie, a
      fair gift even for a Queen to give, and that bride's chaplet shall be
      twined with the fairest pearls that ever were found in the depths of
      Lochlomond; and thou thyself, Mary Fleming, the best dresser of tires that
      ever busked the tresses of a Queen, and who would scorn to touch those of
      any woman of lower rank,&mdash;thou thyself shalt, for my love, twine them
      into the bride's tresses.&mdash;Look, my Fleming, suppose them such
      clustered locks as those of our Catherine, they would not put shame upon
      thy skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she passed her hand fondly over the head of her youthful
      favourite, while her more aged attendant replied despondently, &ldquo;Alas!
      madam, your thoughts stray far from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, my Fleming,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;but is it well or kind in you to
      call them back?&mdash;God knows, they have kept the perch this night but
      too closely&mdash;Come, I will recall the gay vision, were it but to
      punish them. Yes, at that blithesome bridal, Mary herself shall forget the
      weight of sorrows, and the toil of state, and herself once more lead a
      measure.&mdash;At whose wedding was it that we last danced, my Fleming? I
      think care has troubled my memory&mdash;yet something of it I should
      remember&mdash;canst thou not aid me?&mdash;I know thou canst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; replied the lady&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;wilt thou not help us so far? this is a peevish
      adherence to thine own graver opinion, which holds our talk as folly. But
      thou art court-bred, and wilt well understand me when I say, the Queen <i>commands</i>
      Lady Fleming to tell her where she led the last <i>branle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a face deadly pale, and a mien as if she were about to sink into the
      earth, the court-bred dame, no longer daring to refuse obedience, faltered
      out&mdash;&ldquo;Gracious Lady&mdash;if my memory err not&mdash;it was at a
      masque in Holyrood&mdash;at the marriage of Sebastian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy Queen, who had hitherto listened with a melancholy smile,
      provoked by the reluctance with which the Lady Fleming brought out her
      story, at this ill-fated word interrupted her with a shriek so wild and
      loud that the vaulted apartment rang, and both Roland and Catherine sprang
      to their feet in the utmost terror and alarm. Meantime, Mary seemed, by
      the train of horrible ideas thus suddenly excited, surprised not only
      beyond self-command, but for the moment beyond the verge of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitress!&rdquo; she said to the Lady Fleming, &ldquo;thou wouldst slay thy
      sovereign&mdash;Call my French guards&mdash;<i>a moi! a moi! mes Français!</i>&mdash;I
      am beset with traitors in mine own palace&mdash;they have murdered my
      husband&mdash;Rescue! rescue for the Queen of Scotland!&rdquo; She started up
      from her chair&mdash;her features, late so exquisitely lovely in their
      paleness, now inflamed with the fury of frenzy, and resembling those of a
      Bellona. &ldquo;We will take the field ourself,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;warn the city&mdash;warn
      Lothian and Fife&mdash;saddle our Spanish barb, and bid French Paris see
      our petronel be charged!&mdash;Better to die at the head of our brave
      Scotsmen, like our grandfather at Flodden, than of a broken heart, like
      our ill-starred father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient&mdash;be composed, dearest Sovereign,&rdquo; said Catherine: and
      then addressing Lady Fleming angrily, she added, &ldquo;How could you say aught
      that reminded her of her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word reached the ear of the unhappy Princess, who caught it up,
      speaking with great rapidity. &ldquo;Husband!&mdash;what husband?&mdash;Not his
      most Christian Majesty&mdash;he is ill at ease&mdash;he cannot mount on
      horseback.&mdash;Not him of the Lennox&mdash;but it was the Duke of Orkney
      thou wouldst say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's love, madam, be patient!&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Queen's excited imagination could by no entreaty be diverted from
      its course. &ldquo;Bid him come hither to our aid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and bring with
      him his lambs, as he calls them&mdash;Bowton, Hay of Talla, Black
      Ormiston, and his kinsman Hob&mdash;Fie! how swart they are, and how they
      smell of sulphur! What! closeted with Morton? Nay, if the Douglas and the
      Hepburn hatch the complot together, the bird, when it breaks the shell,
      will scare Scotland. Will it not, my Fleming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She grows wilder and wilder,&rdquo; said Fleming; &ldquo;we have too many hearers for
      these strange words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roland,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;in the name of God, begone! You cannot aid us
      here&mdash;Leave us to deal with her alone&mdash;Away&mdash;away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thrust him to the door of the anteroom; yet even when he had entered
      that apartment, and shut the door, he could still hear the Queen talk in a
      loud and determined tone, as if giving forth orders, until at length the
      voice died away in a feeble and continued lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis Catherine entered the anteroom. &ldquo;Be not too anxious,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;the crisis is now over; but keep the door fast&mdash;let no one
      enter until she is more composed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God, what does this mean?&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;or what was
      there in the Lady Fleming's words to excite so wild a transport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Lady Fleming, the Lady Fleming,&rdquo; said Catherine, repeating the
      words impatiently; &ldquo;the Lady Fleming is a fool&mdash;she loves her
      mistress, yet knows so little how to express her love, that were the Queen
      to ask her for very poison, she would deem it a point of duty not to
      resist her commands. I could have torn her starched head-tire from her
      formal head&mdash;The Queen should have as soon had the heart out of my
      body, as the word Sebastian out of my lips&mdash;That that piece of weaved
      tapestry should be a woman, and yet not have wit enough to tell a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was this story of Sebastian?&rdquo; said the page. &ldquo;By Heaven,
      Catherine, you are all riddles alike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as great a fool as Fleming,&rdquo; returned the impatient maiden; &ldquo;know
      ye not, that on the night of Henry Darnley's murder, and at the blowing up
      of the Kirk of Field, the Queen's absence was owing to her attending on a
      masque at Holyrood, given by her to grace the marriage of this same
      Sebastian, who, himself a favoured servant, married one of her female
      attendants, who was near to her person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Giles,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I wonder not at her passion, but only
      marvel by what forgetfulness it was that she could urge the Lady Fleming
      with such a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot account for it,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;but it seems as if great and
      violent grief and horror sometimes obscure the memory, and spread a cloud
      like that of an exploding cannon, over the circumstances with which they
      are accompanied. But I may not stay here, where I came not to moralize
      with your wisdom, but simply to cool my resentment against that unwise
      Lady Fleming, which I think hath now somewhat abated, so that I shall
      endure her presence without any desire to damage either her curch or
      vasquine. Meanwhile, keep fast that door&mdash;I would not for my life
      that any of these heretics saw her in the unhappy state, which, brought on
      her as it has been by the success of their own diabolical plottings, they
      would not stick to call, in their snuffling cant, the judgment of
      Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the apartment just as the latch of the outward door was raised
      from without. But the bolt which Roland had drawn on the inside, resisted
      the efforts of the person desirous to enter. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Graeme
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; replied the harsh and yet slow voice of the steward Dryfesdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot enter now,&rdquo; returned the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo; demanded Dryfesdale, &ldquo;seeing I come but to do my duty,
      and inquire what mean the shrieks from the apartment of the Moabitish
      woman. Wherefore, I say, since such is mine errand, can I not enter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;because the bolt is drawn, and I have no
      fancy to undo it. I have the right side of the door to-day, as you had
      last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art ill-advised, thou malapert boy,&rdquo; replied the steward, &ldquo;to speak
      to me in such fashion; but I shall inform my Lady of thine insolence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The insolence,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;is meant for thee only, in fair guerdon
      of thy discourtesy to me. For thy Lady's information, I have answer more
      courteous&mdash;you may say that the Queen is ill at ease, and desires to
      be disturbed neither by visits nor messages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conjure you, in the name of God,&rdquo; said the old man, with more solemnity
      in his tone than he had hitherto used, &ldquo;to let me know if her malady
      really gains power on her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will have no aid at your hand, or at your Lady's&mdash;wherefore,
      begone, and trouble us no more&mdash;we neither want, nor will accept of,
      aid at your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this positive reply, the steward, grumbling and dissatisfied,
      returned down stairs.

      Chapter the Thirty-Second.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  It is the curse of kings to be attended
  By slaves, who take their humours for a warrant
  To break into the bloody house of life,
  And on the winking of authority
  To understand a law.
                          KING JOHN.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Lady of Lochleven sat alone in her chamber, endeavouring with sincere
      but imperfect zeal, to fix her eyes and her attention on the
      black-lettered Bible which lay before her, bound in velvet and embroidery,
      and adorned with massive silver clasps and knosps. But she found her
      utmost efforts unable to withdraw her mind from the resentful recollection
      of what had last night passed betwixt her and the Queen, in which the
      latter had with such bitter taunt reminded her of her early and
      long-repented transgression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;should I resent so deeply that another reproaches me
      with that which I have never ceased to make matter of blushing to myself?
      and yet, why should this woman, who reaps&mdash;at least, has reaped&mdash;the
      fruits of my folly, and has jostled my son aside from the throne, why
      should she, in the face of all my domestics, and of her own, dare to
      upbraid me with my shame? Is she not in my power? Does she not fear me?
      Ha! wily tempter, I will wrestle with thee strongly, and with better
      suggestions than my own evil heart can supply!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She again took up the sacred volume, and was endeavouring to fix her
      attention on its contents, when she was disturbed by a tap at the door of
      the room. It opened at her command, and the steward Dryfesdale entered,
      and stood before her with a gloomy and perturbed expression on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has chanced, Dryfesdale, that thou lookest thus?&rdquo; said his mistress&mdash;&ldquo;Have
      there been evil tidings of my son, or of my grandchildren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lady,&rdquo; replied Dryfesdale, &ldquo;but you were deeply insulted last night,
      and I fear me thou art as deeply avenged this morning&mdash;Where is the
      chaplain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean you by hints so dark, and a question so sudden? The chaplain,
      as you well know, is absent at Perth upon an assembly of the brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; answered the steward; &ldquo;he is but a priest of Baal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dryfesdale,&rdquo; said the Lady, sternly, &ldquo;what meanest thou? I have ever
      heard, that in the Low Countries thou didst herd with the Anabaptist
      preachers, those boars which tear up the vintage&mdash;But the ministry
      which suits me and my house must content my retainers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would I had good ghostly counsel, though,&rdquo; replied the steward, not
      attending to his mistress's rebuke, and seeming to speak to himself. &ldquo;This
      woman of Moab&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak of her with reverence,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;she is a king's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Dryfesdale; &ldquo;she goes where there is little difference
      betwixt her and a beggar's child&mdash;Mary of Scotland is dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dying, and in my castle!&rdquo; said the Lady, starting up in alarm; &ldquo;of what
      disease, or by what accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear patience, Lady. The ministry was mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thine, villain and traitor!&mdash;how didst thou dare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you insulted, Lady&mdash;I heard you demand vengeance&mdash;I
      promised you should have it, and I now bring tidings of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dryfesdale, I trust thou ravest?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rave not,&rdquo; replied the steward. &ldquo;That which was written of me a million
      of years ere I saw the light, must be executed by me. She hath that in her
      veins that, I fear me, will soon stop the springs of life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cruel
      villain,&rdquo; exclaimed the Lady, &ldquo;thou hast not poisoned her?&rdquo; &ldquo;And if I
      had,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale, &ldquo;what does it so greatly merit? Men bane vermin&mdash;why
      not rid them of their enemies so? in Italy they will do it for a
      cruizuedor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowardly ruffian, begone from my sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think better of my zeal, Lady,&rdquo; said the steward, &ldquo;and judge not without
      looking around you. Lindesay, Ruthven, and your kinsman Morton, poniarded
      Rizzio, and yet you now see no blood on their embroidery&mdash;the Lord
      Semple stabbed the Lord of Sanquhar&mdash;does his bonnet sit a jot more
      awry on his brow? What noble lives in Scotland who has not had a share,
      for policy or revenge, in some such dealing?&mdash;and who imputes it to
      them? Be not cheated with names&mdash;a dagger or a draught work to the
      same end, and are little unlike&mdash;a glass phial imprisons the one, and
      a leathern sheath the other&mdash;one deals with the brain, the other
      sluices the blood&mdash;Yet, I say not I gave aught to this lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dost thou mean by thus dallying with me?&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;as thou
      wouldst save thy neck from the rope it merits, tell me the whole truth of
      this story-thou hast long been known a dangerous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, in my master's service I can be cold and sharp as my sword. Be it
      known to you, that when last on shore, I consulted with a woman of skill
      and power, called Nicneven, of whom the country has rung for some brief
      time past. Fools asked her for charms to make them beloved, misers for
      means to increase their store; some demanded to know the future&mdash;an
      idle wish, since it cannot be altered; others would have an explanation of
      the past&mdash;idler still, since it cannot be recalled. I heard their
      queries with scorn, and demanded the means of avenging myself of a deadly
      enemy, for I grow old, and may trust no longer to Bilboa blade. She gave
      me a packet&mdash;`Mix that,' said she, `with any liquid, and thy
      vengeance is complete.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain! and you mixed it with the food of this imprisoned Lady, to the
      dishonour of thy master's house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To redeem the insulted honour of my master's house, I mixed the contents
      of the packet with the jar of succory-water: They seldom fail to drain it,
      and the woman loves it over all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a work of hell,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven, &ldquo;both the asking and the
      granting.&mdash;Away, wretched man, let us see if aid be yet too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not admit us, madam, save we enter by force&mdash;I have been.
      twice at the door, but can obtain no entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will beat it level with the ground, if needful&mdash;And, hold&mdash;summon
      Randal hither instantly.&mdash;Randal, here is a foul and evil chance
      befallen&mdash;send off a boat instantly to Kinross, the Chamberlain Luke
      Lundin is said to have skill&mdash;Fetch off, too, that foul witch
      Nicneven; she shall first counteract her own spell, and then be burned to
      ashes in the island of Saint Serf. Away, away&mdash;Tell them to hoist
      sail and ply oar, as ever they would have good of the Douglas's hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Nicneven will not be lightly found, or fetched hither on these
      conditions,&rdquo; answered Dryfesdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then grant her full assurance of safety&mdash;Look to it, for thine own
      life must answer for this lady's recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have guessed that,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale, sullenly; &ldquo;but it is my
      comfort I have avenged mine own cause, as well as yours. She hath scoffed
      and scripped at me, and encouraged her saucy minion of a page to ridicule
      my stiff gait and slow speech. I felt it borne in upon me that I was to be
      avenged on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the western turret,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;and remain there in ward until
      we see how this gear will terminate. I know thy resolved disposition&mdash;thou
      wilt not attempt escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not were the walls of the turret of egg-shells, and the lake sheeted
      ice,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale. &ldquo;I am well taught, and strong in belief, that man
      does nought of himself; he is but the foam on the billow, which rises,
      bubbles, and bursts, not by its own effort, but by the mightier impulse of
      fate which urges him. Yet, Lady, if I may advise, amid this zeal for the
      life of the Jezebel of Scotland, forget not what is due to thine own
      honour, and keep the matter secret as you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the gloomy fatalist turned from her, and stalked off with
      sullen composure to the place of confinement allotted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lady caught at his last hint, and only expressed her fear that the
      prisoner had partaken of some unwholesome food, and was dangerously ill.
      The castle was soon alarmed and in confusion. Randal was dispatched to the
      shore to fetch off Lundin, with such remedies as could counteract poison;
      and with farther instructions to bring mother Nicneven, if she could be
      found, with full power to pledge the Lady of Lochleven's word for her
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Lady of Lochleven herself held parley at the door of the
      Queen's apartment, and in vain urged the page to undo it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish boy!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thine own life and thy Lady's are at stake&mdash;Open,
      I say, or we will cause the door to be broken down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not open the door without my royal mistress's orders,&rdquo; answered
      Roland; &ldquo;she has been very ill, and now she slumbers&mdash;if you wake her
      by using violence, let the consequence be on you and your followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was ever woman in a strait so fearful!&rdquo; exclaimed the Lady of Lochleven&mdash;&ldquo;At
      least, thou rash boy, beware that no one tastes the food, but especially
      the jar of succory-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then hastened to the turret, where Dryfesdale had composedly resigned
      himself to imprisonment. She found him reading, and demanded of him, &ldquo;Was
      thy fell potion of speedy operation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slow,&rdquo; answered the steward. &ldquo;The hag asked me which I chose&mdash;I told
      her I loved a slow and sure revenge. 'Revenge,' said I, 'is the
      highest-flavoured draught which man tastes upon earth, and he should sip
      it by little and little&mdash;not drain it up greedily at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against whom, unhappy man, couldst thou nourish so fell a revenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had many objects, but the chief was that insolent page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy!&mdash;thou inhuman man!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady; &ldquo;what could he do
      to deserve thy malice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He rose in your favour, and you graced him with your commissions&mdash;that
      was one thing. He rose in that of George Douglas's also&mdash;that was
      another. He was the favourite of the Calvinistic Henderson, who hated me
      because my spirit disowns a separated priesthood. The Moabitish Queen held
      him dear&mdash;winds from each opposing point blew in his favour&mdash;the
      old servitor of your house was held lightly among ye&mdash;above all, from
      the first time I saw his face, I longed to destroy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fiend have I nurtured in my house!&rdquo; replied the Lady. &ldquo;May God
      forgive me the sin of having given thee food and raiment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might not choose, Lady,&rdquo; answered the steward. &ldquo;Long ere this castle
      was builded&mdash;ay, long ere the islet which sustains it reared its head
      above the blue water, I was destined to be your faithful slave, and you to
      be my ungrateful mistress. Remember you not when I plunged amid the
      victorious French, in the time of this lady's mother, and brought off your
      husband, when those who had hung at the same breasts with him dared not
      attempt the rescue?&mdash;Remember how I plunged into the lake when your
      grandson's skiff was overtaken by the tempest, boarded, and steered her
      safe to the land. Lady&mdash;the servant of a Scottish baron is he who
      regards not his own life, or that of any other, save his master. And, for
      the death of the woman, I had tried the potion on her sooner, had not
      Master George been her taster. Her death&mdash;would it not be the
      happiest news that Scotland ever heard? Is she not of the bloody Guisian
      stock, whose sword was so often red with the blood of God's saints? Is she
      not the daughter of the wretched tyrant James, whom Heaven cast down from
      his kingdom, and his pride, even as the king of Babylon was smitten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, villain!&rdquo; said the Lady&mdash;a thousand varied recollections
      thronging on her mind at the mention of her royal lover's name; &ldquo;Peace,
      and disturb not the ashes of the dead&mdash;of the royal, of the unhappy
      dead. Read thy Bible; and may God grant thee to avail thyself better of
      its contents than thou hast yet done!&rdquo; She departed hastily, and as she
      reached the next apartment, the tears rose in her eyes so hastily, that
      she was compelled to stop and use her kerchief to dry them. &ldquo;I expected
      not this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no more than to have drawn water from the dry flint,
      or sap from a withered tree. I saw with a dry eye the apostacy and shame
      of George Douglas, the hope of my son's house&mdash;the child of my love;
      and yet I now weep for him who has so long lain in his grave&mdash;for him
      to whom I owe it that his daughter can make a scoffing and a jest of my
      name! But she is <i>his</i> daughter&mdash;my heart, hardened against her
      for so many causes, relents when a glance of her eye places her father
      unexpectedly before me&mdash;and as often her likeness to that true
      daughter of the house of Guise, her detested mother, has again confirmed
      my resolution. But she must not&mdash;must not die in my house, and by so
      foul a practice. Thank God, the operation of the potion is slow, and may
      be counteracted. I will to her apartment once more. But oh! that hardened
      villain, whose fidelity we held in such esteem, and had such high proof
      of! What miracle can unite so much wickedness and so much truth in one
      bosom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Lochleven was not aware how far minds of a certain gloomy and
      determined cast by nature, may be warped by a keen sense of petty injuries
      and insults, combining with the love of gain, and sense of self-interest,
      and amalgamated with the crude, wild, and indigested fanatical opinions
      which this man had gathered among the crazy sectaries of Germany; or how
      far the doctrines of fatalism, which he had embraced so decidedly, sear
      the human conscience, by representing our actions as the result of
      inevitable necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her visit to the prisoner, Roland had communicated to Catherine the
      tenor of the conversation he had had with her at the door of the
      apartment. The quick intelligence of that lively maiden instantly
      comprehended the outline of what was believed to have happened, but her
      prejudices hurried her beyond the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant to have poisoned us,&rdquo; she exclaimed in horror, &ldquo;and there
      stands the fatal liquor which should have done the deed!&mdash;Ay, as soon
      as Douglas ceased to be our taster, our food was likely to be fatally
      seasoned. Thou, Roland, who shouldst have made the essay, wert readily
      doomed to die with us. Oh, dearest Lady Fleming, pardon, pardon, for the
      injuries I said to you in my anger&mdash;your words were prompted by
      Heaven to save our lives, and especially that of the injured Queen. But
      what have we now to do? that old crocodile of the lake will be presently
      back to shed her hypocritical tears over our dying agonies.&mdash;Lady
      Fleming, what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Lady help us in our need!&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;how should I tell?&mdash;unless
      we were to make our plaint to the Regent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make our plaint to the devil,&rdquo; said Catherine impatiently, &ldquo;and accuse
      his dam at the foot of his burning throne!&mdash;The Queen still sleeps&mdash;we
      must gain time. The poisoning hag must not know her scheme has miscarried;
      the old envenomed spider has but too many ways of mending her broken web.
      The jar of succory-water,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;Roland, if thou be'st a man,
      help me&mdash;empty the jar on the chimney or from the window&mdash;make
      such waste among the viands as if we had made our usual meal, and leave
      the fragments on cup and porringer, but taste nothing as thou lovest thy
      life. I will sit by the Queen, and tell her at her waking, in what a
      fearful pass we stand. Her sharp wit and ready spirit will teach us what
      is best to be done. Meanwhile, till farther notice, observe, Roland, that
      the Queen is in a state of torpor&mdash;that Lady Fleming is indisposed&mdash;that
      character&rdquo; (speaking in a lower tone) &ldquo;will suit her best, and save her
      wits some labour in vain. I am not so much indisposed, thou
      understandest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; said the page&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; replied Catherine, &ldquo;you are quite well&mdash;who thinks it worth
      while to poison puppy-dogs or pages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this levity become the time?&rdquo; asked the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, it does,&rdquo; answered Catherine Seyton; &ldquo;if the Queen approves, I
      see plainly how this disconcerted attempt may do us good service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to work while she spoke, eagerly assisted by Roland. The
      breakfast table soon displayed the appearance as if the meal had been
      eaten as usual; and the ladies retired as softly as possible into the
      Queen's sleeping apartment. At a new summons of the Lady Lochleven, the
      page undid the door, and admitted her into the anteroom, asking her pardon
      for having withstood her, alleging in excuse, that the Queen had fallen
      into a heavy slumber since she had broken her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has eaten and drunken, then?&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;according to her Grace's ordinary custom,
      unless upon the fasts of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jar,&rdquo; she said, hastily examining it, &ldquo;it is empty&mdash;drank the
      Lady Mary the whole of this water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large part, madam; and I heard the Lady Catherine Seyton jestingly
      upbraid the Lady Mary Fleming with having taken more than a just share of
      what remained, so that but little fell to her own lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are they well in health?&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Fleming,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;complains of lethargy, and looks duller
      than usual; and the Lady Catherine of Seyton feels her head somewhat more
      giddy than is her wont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his voice a little as he said these words, to apprise the ladies
      of the part assigned to each of them, and not, perhaps, without the wish
      of conveying to the ears of Catherine the page-like jest which lurked in
      the allotment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will enter the Queen's bedchamber,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven; &ldquo;my
      business is express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she advanced to the door, the voice of Catherine Seyton was heard from
      within&mdash;&ldquo;No one can enter here&mdash;the Queen sleeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be controlled, young lady,&rdquo; replied the Lady of Lochleven;
      &ldquo;there is, I wot, no inner bar, and I will enter in your despite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, indeed, no inner bar,&rdquo; answered Catherine, firmly, &ldquo;but there
      are the staples where that bar should be; and into those staples have I
      thrust mine arm, like an ancestress of your own, when, better employed
      than the Douglasses of our days, she thus defended the bedchamber of her
      sovereign against murderers. Try your force, then, and see whether a
      Seyton cannot rival in courage a maiden of the house of Douglas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not attempt the pass at such risk,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven:
      &ldquo;Strange, that this Princess, with all that justly attaches to her as
      blameworthy, should preserve such empire over the minds of her attendants.&mdash;Damsel,
      I give thee my honour that I come for the Queen's safety and advantage.
      Awaken her, if thou lovest her, and pray her leave that I may enter&mdash;I
      will retire from the door the whilst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt not awaken the Queen?&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What choice have we?&rdquo; said the ready-witted maiden, &ldquo;unless you deem it
      better to wait till the Lady Lochleven herself plays lady of the
      bedchamber. Her fit of patience will not last long, and the Queen must be
      prepared to meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thou wilt bring back her Grace's fit by thus disturbing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; replied Catherine; &ldquo;but if so, it must pass for an effect
      of the poison. I hope better things, and that the Queen will be able when
      she wakes to form her own judgment in this terrible crisis. Meanwhile, do
      thou, dear Lady Fleming, practise to look as dull and heavy as the
      alertness of thy spirit will permit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine kneeled by the side of the Queen's bed, and, kissing her hand
      repeatedly, succeeded at last in awakening without alarming her. She
      seemed surprised to find that she was ready dressed, but sate up in her
      bed, and appeared so perfectly composed, that Catherine Seyton, without
      farther preamble, judged it safe to inform her of the predicament in which
      they were placed. Mary turned pale, and crossed herself again and again,
      when she heard the imminent danger in which she had stood. But, like the
      Ulysses of Homer,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;Hardly waking yet,
  Sprung in her mind the momentary wit,
</pre>
    <p>
      and she at once understood her situation, with the dangers and advantages
      that attended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot do better,&rdquo; she said, after her hasty conference with
      Catherine, pressing her at the same time to her bosom, and kissing her
      forehead; &ldquo;we cannot do better than to follow the scheme so happily
      devised by thy quick wit and bold affection. Undo the door to the Lady
      Lochleven&mdash;She shall meet her match in art, though not in perfidy.
      Fleming, draw close the curtain, and get thee behind it&mdash;thou art a
      better tire-woman than an actress; do but breathe heavily, and, if thou
      wilt, groan slightly, and it will top thy part. Hark! they come. Now,
      Catherine of Medicis, may thy spirit inspire me, for a cold northern brain
      is too blunt for this scene!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ushered by Catherine Seyton, and stepping as light as she could, the Lady
      Lochleven was shown into the twilight apartment, and conducted to the side
      of the couch, where Mary, pallid and exhausted from a sleepless night, and
      the subsequent agitation of the morning, lay extended so listlessly as
      might well confirm the worst fears of her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, God forgive us our sins!&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, forgetting her
      pride, and throwing herself on her knees by the side of the bed; &ldquo;It is
      too true&mdash;she is murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is in the chamber?&rdquo; said Mary, as if awaking from a heavy sleep.
      &ldquo;Seyton, Fleming, where are you? I heard a strange voice. Who waits?&mdash;Call
      Courcelles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! her memory is at Holyrood, though her body is at Lochleven.&mdash;Forgive,
      madam,&rdquo; continued the Lady, &ldquo;if I call your attention to me&mdash;I am
      Margaret Erskine, of the house of Mar, by marriage Lady Douglas of
      Lochleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, our gentle hostess,&rdquo; answered the Queen, &ldquo;who hath such care of our
      lodgings and of our diet&mdash;We cumber you too much and too long, good
      Lady of Lochleven; but we now trust your task of hospitality is well-nigh
      ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her words go like a knife through my heart,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven&mdash;&ldquo;With
      a breaking heart, I pray your Grace to tell me what is your ailment, that
      aid may be had, if there be yet time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my ailment,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;is nothing worth telling, or worth
      a leech's notice&mdash;my limbs feel heavy&mdash;my heart feels cold&mdash;a
      prisoner's limbs and heart are rarely otherwise&mdash;fresh air, methinks,
      and freedom, would soon revive me; but as the Estates have ordered it,
      death alone can break my prison-doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it possible, madam,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;that your liberty could restore
      your perfect health, I would myself encounter the resentment of the Regent&mdash;of
      my son, Sir William&mdash;of my whole friends, rather than you should meet
      your fate in this castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming, who conceived the time propitious to
      show that her own address had been held too lightly of; &ldquo;it is but trying
      what good freedom may work upon us; for myself, I think a free walk on the
      greensward would do me much good at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady of Lochleven rose from the bedside, and darted a penetrating look
      at the elder valetudinary. &ldquo;Are you so evil-disposed, Lady Fleming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evil-disposed indeed, madam,&rdquo; replied the court dame, &ldquo;and more
      especially since breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, anxious to break off a conversation
      which boded her schemes no good; &ldquo;help! I say, help! the Queen is about to
      pass away. Aid her, Lady Lochleven, if you be a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady hastened to support the Queen's head, who, turning her eyes
      towards her with an air of great languor, exclaimed, &ldquo;Thanks, my dearest
      Lady of Lochleven&mdash;notwithstanding some passages of late, I have
      never misconstrued or misdoubted your affection to our house. It was
      proved, as I have heard, before I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Lochleven sprung from the floor, on which she had again knelt,
      and, having paced the apartment in great disorder, flung open the lattice,
      as if to get air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Our Lady forgive me!&rdquo; said Catherine to herself. &ldquo;How deep must the
      love of sarcasm, be implanted in the breasts of us women, since the Queen,
      with all her sense, will risk ruin rather than rein in her wit!&rdquo; She then
      adventured, stooping over the Queen's person, to press her arm with her
      hand, saying, at the same time, &ldquo;For God's sake, madam, restrain
      yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art too forward, maiden,&rdquo; said the Queen; but immediately added, in
      a low whisper, &ldquo;Forgive me, Catherine; but when I felt the hag's murderous
      hands busy about my head and neck, I felt such disgust and hatred, that I
      must have said something, or died. But I will be schooled to better
      behaviour&mdash;only see that thou let her not touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, God be praised!&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven, withdrawing her head from
      the window, &ldquo;the boat comes as fast as sail and oar can send wood through
      water. It brings the leech and a female&mdash;certainly, from the
      appearance, the very person I was in quest of. Were she but well out of
      this castle, with our honour safe, I would that she were on the top of the
      wildest mountain in Norway; or I would I had been there myself, ere I had
      undertaken this trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she thus expressed herself, standing apart at one window, Roland
      Graeme, from the other, watched the boat bursting through the waters of
      the lake, which glided from its side in ripple and in foam. He, too,
      became sensible, that at the stern was seated the medical Chamberlain,
      clad in his black velvet cloak; and that his own relative, Magdalen
      Graeme, in her assumed character of Mother Nieneven, stood in the bow, her
      hands clasped together, and pointed towards the castle, and her attitude,
      even at that distance, expressing enthusiastic eagerness to arrive at the
      landing-place. They arrived there accordingly, and while the supposed
      witch was detained in a room beneath, the physician was ushered to the
      Queen's apartment, which he entered with all due professional solemnity.
      Catherine had, in the meanwhile, fallen back from the Queen's bed, and
      taken an opportunity to whisper to Roland, &ldquo;Methinks, from the information
      of the threadbare velvet cloak and the solemn beard, there would be little
      trouble in haltering yonder ass. But thy grandmother, Roland&mdash;thy
      grandmother's zeal will ruin us, if she get not a hint to dissemble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland, without reply, glided towards the door of the apartment, crossed
      the parlour, and safely entered the antechamber; but when he attempted to
      pass farther, the word &ldquo;Back! Back!&rdquo; echoed from one to the other, by two
      men armed with carabines, convinced him that the Lady of Lochleven's
      suspicions had not, even in the midst of her alarms, been so far lulled to
      sleep as to omit the precaution of stationing sentinels on her prisoners.
      He was compelled, therefore, to return to the parlour, or
      audience-chamber, in which he found the Lady of the castle in conference
      with her learned leech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce with your cant phrase and your solemn foppery, Lundin,&rdquo; in such
      terms she accosted the man of art, &ldquo;and let me know instantly, if thou
      canst tell, whether this lady hath swallowed aught that is less than
      wholesome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, good lady&mdash;honoured patroness&mdash;to whom I am alike
      bonds-man in my medical and official capacity, deal reasonably with me. If
      this, mine illustrious patient, will not answer a question, saving with
      sighs and moans&mdash;if that other honourable lady will do nought but
      yawn in my face when I inquire after the diagnostics&mdash;and if that
      other young damsel, who I profess is a comely maiden&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not to me of comeliness or of damsels,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven,
      &ldquo;I say, are they evil-disposed?&mdash;In one word, man, have they taken
      poison, ay or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisons, madam,&rdquo; said the learned leech, &ldquo;are of various sorts. There is
      your animal poison, as the lepus marinus, as mentioned by Dioscorides and
      Galen&mdash;there are mineral and semi-mineral poisons, as those
      compounded of sublimate regulus of antimony, vitriol, and the arsenical
      salts&mdash;there are your poisons from herbs and vegetables, as the aqua
      cymbalariae, opium, aconitum, cantharides, and the like&mdash;there are
      also&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, out upon thee for a learned fool! and I myself am no better for
      expecting an oracle from such a log,&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but if your ladyship will have patience&mdash;if I knew what food
      they have partaken of, or could see but the remnants of what they have
      last eaten&mdash;for as to the external and internal symptoms, I can
      discover nought like; for, as Galen saith in his second book <i>de
      Antidotis</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, fool!&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;send me that hag hither; she shall avouch
      what it was that she hath given to the wretch Dryfesdale, or the
      pilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench it out of her finger joints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art hath no enemy unless the ignorant,&rdquo; said the mortified Doctor;
      veiling, however, his remark under the Latin version, and stepping apart
      into a corner to watch the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute or two Magdalen Graeme entered the apartment, dressed as we
      have described her at the revel, but with her muffler thrown back, and all
      affectation of disguise. She was attended by two guards, of whose presence
      she did not seem even to be conscious, and who followed her with an air of
      embarrassment and timidity, which was probably owing to their belief in
      her supernatural power, coupled with the effect produced by her bold and
      undaunted demeanour. She confronted the Lady of Lochleven, who seemed to
      endure with high disdain the confidence of her air and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched woman!&rdquo; said the Lady, after essaying for a moment to bear her
      down, before she addressed her, by the stately severity of her look, &ldquo;what
      was that powder which thou didst give to a servant of this house, by name
      Jasper Dryfesdale, that he might work out with it some slow and secret
      vengeance?&mdash;Confess its nature and properties, or, by the honour of
      Douglas, I give thee to fire and stake before the sun is lower!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme in reply, &ldquo;and when became a Douglas or a
      Douglas's man so unfurnished in his revenge, that he should seek them at
      the hands of a poor and solitary woman? The towers in which your captives
      pine away into unpitied graves, yet stand fast on their foundation&mdash;the
      crimes wrought in them have not yet burst their vaults asunder&mdash;your
      men have still their cross-bows, pistolets, and daggers&mdash;why need you
      seek to herbs or charms for the execution of your revenges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, foul hag,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven,&mdash;&ldquo;but what avails
      speaking to thee?&mdash;Bring Dryfesdale hither, and let them be
      confronted together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may spare your retainers the labour,&rdquo; replied Magdalen Graeme. &ldquo;I
      came not here to be confronted with a base groom, nor to answer the
      interrogatories of James's heretical leman&mdash;I came to speak with the
      Queen of Scotland&mdash;Give place there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while the Lady Lochleven stood confounded at her boldness, and at the
      reproach she had cast upon her, Magdalen Graeme strode past her into the
      bedchamber of the Queen, and, kneeling on the floor, made a salutation as
      if, in the Oriental fashion, she meant to touch the earth with her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, Princess!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;hail, daughter of many a King, but graced
      above them all in that thou art called to suffer for the true faith&mdash;hail
      to thee, the pure gold of whose crown has been tried in the seven-times
      heated furnace of affliction&mdash;hear the comfort which God and Our Lady
      send thee by the mouth of thy unworthy servant.&mdash;But first&rdquo;&mdash;and
      stooping her head she crossed herself repeatedly, and, still upon her
      knees, appeared to be rapidly reciting some formula of devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize her, and drag her to the massy-more!&mdash;to the deepest dungeon
      with the sorceress, whose master, the Devil, could alone have inspired her
      with boldness enough to insult the mother of Douglas in his own castle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke the incensed Lady of Lochleven, but the physician presumed to
      interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray of you, honoured madam, she be permitted to take her course
      without interruption. Peradventure we shall learn something concerning the
      nostrum she hath ventured, contrary to law and the rules of art, to
      adhibit to these ladies, through the medium of the steward Dryfesdale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a fool,&rdquo; replied the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;thou hast counselled wisely&mdash;I
      will bridle my resentment till their conference be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, honoured Lady,&rdquo; said Doctor Lundin, &ldquo;that you should suppress
      it longer&mdash;nothing may more endanger the frame of your honoured body;
      and truly, if there be witchcraft in this matter, it is held by the
      vulgar, and even by solid authors on Demonology, that three scruples of
      the ashes of the witch, when she hath been well and carefully burned at a
      stake, is a grand Catholicon in such matter, even as they prescribe <i>crinis
      canis rabidi</i>, a hair of the dog that bit the patient, in cases of
      hydrophobia. I warrant neither treatment, being out of the regular
      practice of the schools; but, in the present case, there can be little
      harm in trying the conclusion upon this old necromancer and quacksalver-<i>fiat
      experimentum</i> (as we say) <i>in corpore vili</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, fool!&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;she is about to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Magdalen Graeme arose from her knees, and turned her
      countenance on the Queen, at the same time advancing her foot, extending
      her arm, and assuming the mien and attitude of a Sibyl in frenzy. As her
      gray hair floated back from beneath her coif, and her eye gleamed fire
      from under its shaggy eyebrow, the effect of her expressive though
      emaciated features, was heightened by an enthusiasm approaching to
      insanity, and her appearance struck with awe all who were present. Her
      eyes for a time glanced wildly around as if seeking for something to aid
      her in collecting her powers of expression, and her lips had a nervous and
      quivering motion, as those of one who would fain speak, yet rejects as
      inadequate the words which present themselves. Mary herself caught the
      infection as if by a sort of magnetic influence, and raising herself from
      her bed, without being able to withdraw her eyes from those of Magdalen,
      waited as if for the oracle of a Pythoness. She waited not long, for no
      sooner had the enthusiast collected herself, than her gaze became
      instantly steady, her features assumed a determined energy, and when she
      began to speak, the words flowed from her with a profuse fluency, which
      might have passed for inspiration, and which, perhaps, she herself mistook
      for such.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Queen of France and of England! Arise, Lioness of
      Scotland, and be not dismayed though the nets of the hunters have
      encircled thee! Stoop not to feign with the false ones, whom thou shall
      soon meet in the field. The issue of battle is with the God of armies, but
      by battle thy cause shall be tried. Lay aside, then, the arts of lower
      mortals, and assume those which become a Queen! True defender of the only
      true faith, the armoury of heaven is open to thee! Faithful daughter of
      the Church, take the keys of St. Peter, to bind and to loose!&mdash;Royal
      Princess of the land, take the sword of St. Paul, to smite and to shear!
      There is darkness in thy destiny;&mdash;but not in these towers, not under
      the rule of their haughty mistress, shall that destiny be closed&mdash;In
      other lands the lioness may crouch to the power of the tigress, but not in
      her own&mdash;not in Scotland shall the Queen of Scotland long remain
      captive&mdash;nor is the fate of the royal Stuart in the hands of the
      traitor Douglas. Let the Lady of Lochleven double her bolts and deepen her
      dungeons, they shall not retain thee&mdash;each element shall give thee
      its assistance ere thou shalt continue captive&mdash;the land shall lend
      its earthquakes, the water its waves, the air its tempests, the fire its
      devouring flames, to desolate this house, rather than it shall continue
      the place of thy captivity.&mdash;Hear this, and tremble, all ye who fight
      against the light, for she says it, to whom it hath been assured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, and the astonished physician said, &ldquo;If there was ever an
      <i>Energumene,</i> or possessed demoniac, in our days, there is a devil
      speaking with that woman's tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practice,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, recovering her surprise; &ldquo;here is
      all practice and imposture&mdash;To the dungeon with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady of Lochleven,&rdquo; said Mary, arising from her bed, and coming forward
      with her wonted dignity, &ldquo;ere you make arrest on any one in our presence,
      hear me but one word. I have done you some wrong&mdash;I believed you
      privy to the murderous purpose of your vassal, and I deceived you in
      suffering you to believe it had taken effect. I did you wrong, Lady of
      Lochleven, for I perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere. We tasted
      not of the liquid, nor are we now sick, save that we languish for our
      freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is avowed like Mary of Scotland,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme; &ldquo;and know,
      besides, that had the Queen drained the drought to the dregs, it was
      harmless as the water from a sainted spring. Trow ye, proud woman,&rdquo; she
      added, addressing herself to the Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;that I&mdash;I&mdash;would
      have been the wretch to put poison into the hands of a servant or vassal
      of the house of Lochleven, knowing whom that house contained? as soon
      would I have furnished drug to slay my own daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I thus bearded in mine own castle?&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;to the dungeon
      with her!&mdash;she shall abye what is due to the vender of poisons and
      practiser of witchcraft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet hear me for an instant, Lady of Lochleven,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;and do you,&rdquo;
       to Magdalen, &ldquo;be silent at my command.&mdash;Your steward, lady, has by
      confession attempted my life, and those of my household, and this woman
      hath done her best to save them, by furnishing him with what was harmless,
      in place of the fatal drugs which he expected. Methinks I propose to you
      but a fair exchange when I say I forgive your vassal with all my heart,
      and leave vengeance to God, and to his conscience, so that you also
      forgive the boldness of this woman in your presence; for we trust you do
      not hold it as a crime, that she substituted an innocent beverage for the
      mortal poison which was to have drenched our cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forfend, madam,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;that I should account that a
      crime which saved the house of Douglas from a foul breach of honour and
      hospitality! We have written to our son touching our vassal's delict, and
      he must abide his doom, which will most likely be death. Touching this
      woman, her trade is damnable by Scripture, and is mortally punished by the
      wise laws of our ancestry&mdash;she also must abide her doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have I then,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;no claim on the house of Lochleven for
      the wrong I have so nearly suffered within their walls? I ask but in
      requital, the life of a frail and aged woman, whose brain, as yourself may
      judge, seems somewhat affected by years and suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Lady Mary,&rdquo; replied the inflexible Lady of Lochleven, &ldquo;hath been
      menaced with wrong in the house of Douglas, it may be regarded as some
      compensation, that her complots have cost that house the exile of a valued
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plead no more for me, my gracious Sovereign,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;nor
      abase yourself to ask so much as a gray hair of my head at her hands. I
      knew the risk at which I served my Church and my Queen, and was ever
      prompt to pay my poor life as the ransom. It is a comfort to think, that
      in slaying me, or in restraining my freedom, or even in injuring that
      single gray hair, the house, whose honour she boasts so highly, will have
      filled up the measure of their shame by the breach of their solemn written
      assurance of safety.&rdquo;&mdash;And taking from her bosom a paper, she handed
      it to the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a solemn assurance of safety in life and limb,&rdquo; said Queen Mary,
      &ldquo;with space to come and go, under the hand and seal of the Chamberlain of
      Kinross, granted to Magdalen Graeme, commonly called Mother Nicneven, in
      consideration of her consenting to put herself, for the space of
      twenty-four hours, if required, within the iron gate of the Castle of
      Lochleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knave!&rdquo; said the Lady, turning to the Chamberlain, &ldquo;how dared you grant
      her such a protection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was by your Ladyship's orders, transmitted by Randal, as he can bear
      witness,&rdquo; replied Doctor Lundin; &ldquo;nay, I am only like the pharmacopolist,
      who compounds the drugs after the order of the mediciner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember&mdash;I remember,&rdquo; answered the Lady; &ldquo;but I meant the
      assurance only to be used in case, by residing in another jurisdiction,
      she could not have been apprehended under our warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;the Lady of Lochleven is bound by the
      action of her deputy in granting the assurance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady, &ldquo;the house of Douglas have never broken their
      safe-conduct, and never will&mdash;too deeply did they suffer by such a
      breach of trust, exercised on themselves, when your Grace's ancestor, the
      second James, in defiance of the rights of hospitality, and of his own
      written assurance of safety, poniarded the brave Earl of Douglas with his
      own hand, and within two yards of the social board, at which he had just
      before sat the King of Scotland's honoured guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said the Queen, carelessly, &ldquo;in consideration of so very
      recent and enormous a tragedy, which I think only chanced some six-score
      years agone, the Douglasses should have shown themselves less tenacious of
      the company of their sovereigns, than you, Lady of Lochleven, seem to be
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Randal,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;take the hag back to Kinross, and set her at
      full liberty, discharging her from our bounds in future, on peril of her
      head.&mdash;And let your wisdom,&rdquo; to the Chamberlain, &ldquo;keep her company.
      And fear not for your character, though I send you in such company; for,
      granting her to be a witch, it would be a waste of fagots to burn you for
      a wizard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crest-fallen Chamberlain was preparing to depart; but Magdalen Graeme,
      collecting herself, was about to reply, when the Queen interposed, saying,
      &ldquo;Good mother, we heartily thank you for your unfeigned zeal towards our
      person, and pray you, as our liege-woman, that you abstain from whatever
      may lead you into personal danger; and, farther, it is our will that you
      depart without a word of farther parley with any one in this castle. For
      thy present guerdon, take this small reliquary&mdash;it was given to us by
      our uncle the Cardinal, and hath had the benediction of the Holy Father
      himself;&mdash;and now depart in peace and in silence.&mdash;For you,
      learned sir,&rdquo; continued the Queen, advancing to the Doctor, who made his
      reverence in a manner doubly embarrassed by the awe of the Queen's
      presence, which made him fear to do too little, and by the apprehension of
      his lady's displeasure, in case he should chance to do too much&mdash;&ldquo;for
      you, learned sir, as it was not your fault, though surely our own good
      fortune, that we did not need your skill at this time, it would not become
      us, however circumstanced, to suffer our leech to leave us without such
      guerdon as we can offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and with the grace which never forsook her, though, in
      the present case, there might lurk under it a little gentle ridicule, she
      offered a small embroidered purse to the Chamberlain, who, with extended
      hand and arched back, his learned face stooping until a physiognomist
      might have practised the metoposcopical science upon it, as seen from
      behind betwixt his gambadoes, was about to accept of the professional
      recompense offered by so fair as well as illustrious a hand. But the Lady
      interposed, and, regarding the Chamberlain, said aloud, &ldquo;No servant of our
      house, without instantly relinquishing that character, and incurring
      withal our highest displeasure, shall dare receive any gratuity at the
      hand of the Lady Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadly and slowly the Chamberlain raised his depressed stature into the
      perpendicular attitude, and left the apartment dejectedly, followed by
      Magdalen Graeme, after, with mute but expressive gesture, she had kissed
      the reliquary with which the Queen had presented her, and, raising her
      clasped hands and uplifted eyes towards Heaven, had seemed to entreat a
      benediction upon the royal dame. As she left the castle, and went towards
      the quay where the boat lay, Roland Graeme, anxious to communicate with
      her if possible, threw himself in her way, and might have succeeded in
      exchanging a few words with her, as she was guarded only by the dejected
      Chamberlain and his halberdiers, but she seemed to have taken, in its most
      strict and literal acceptation, the command to be silent which she had
      received from the Queen; for, to the repeated signs of her grandson, she
      only replied by laying her finger on her lip. Dr. Lundin was not so
      reserved. Regret for the handsome gratuity, and for the compulsory task of
      self-denial imposed on him, had grieved the spirit of that worthy officer
      and learned mediciner&mdash;&ldquo;Even thus, my friend,&rdquo; said he, squeezing the
      page's hand as he bade him farewell, &ldquo;is merit rewarded. I came to cure
      this unhappy Lady&mdash;and I profess she well deserves the trouble, for,
      say what they will of her, she hath a most winning manner, a sweet voice,
      a gracious smile, and a most majestic wave of her hand. If she was not
      poisoned, say, my dear Master Roland, was that fault of mine, I being
      ready to cure her if she had?&mdash;and now I am denied the permission to
      accept my well-earned honorarium&mdash;O Galen! O Hippocrates! is the
      graduate's cap and doctor's scarlet brought to this pass! <i>Frustra
      fatigamus remediis aegros!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his eyes, stepped on the gunwale, and the boat pushed off from
      the shore, and went merrily across the lake, which was dimpled by the
      summer wind. [Footnote: A romancer, to use a Scottish phrase, wants but a
      hair to make a tether of. The whole detail of the steward's supposed
      conspiracy against the life of Mary, is grounded upon an expression in one
      of her letters, which affirms, that Jasper Dryfesdale, one of the Laird of
      Lochleven's servants, had threatened to murder William Douglas, (for his
      share in the Queen's escape,) and averred that he would plant a dagger in
      Mary's own heart.&mdash;CHALMER'S <i>Life of Queen Mary</i>, vol. i. p.

      Chapter the Thirty-Third.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Death distant?&mdash;No, alas! he's ever with us,
  And shakes the dart at us in all our actings:
  He lurks within our cup, while we're in health;
  Sits by our sick-bed, mocks our medicines;
  We cannot walk, or sit, or ride, or travel,
  But Death is by to seize us when he lists.
                         THE SPANISH FATHER.
</pre>
    <p>
      From the agitating scene in the Queen's presence-chamber, the Lady of
      Lochleven retreated to her own apartment, and ordered the steward to be
      called before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they not disarmed thee, Dryfesdale?&rdquo; she said, on seeing him enter,
      accoutred, as usual, with sword and dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;how should they?&mdash;Your ladyship, when you
      commanded me to ward, said nought of laying down my arms; and, I think
      none of your menials, without your order, or your son's, dare approach
      Jasper Dryfesdale for such a purpose.&mdash;Shall I now give up my sword
      to you?&mdash;it is worth little now, for it has fought for your house
      till it is worn down to old iron, like the pantler's old chipping knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have attempted a deadly crime&mdash;poison under trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under trust?&mdash;hem!&mdash;I know not what your ladyship thinks of it,
      but the world without thinks the trust was given you even for that very
      end; and you would have been well off had it been so ended as I proposed,
      and you neither the worse nor the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, &ldquo;and fool as well as villain, who could not
      even execute the crime he had planned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid as fair for it as man could,&rdquo; replied Dryfesdale; &ldquo;I went to a
      woman&mdash;a witch and a Papist&mdash;If I found not poison, it was
      because it was otherwise predestined. I tried fair for it; but the
      half-done job may be clouted, if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain! I am even now about to send off an express messenger to my son,
      to take order how thou shouldst be disposed of. Prepare thyself for death,
      if thou canst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that looks on death, Lady,&rdquo; answered Dryfesdale, &ldquo;as that which he may
      not shun, and which has its own fixed and certain hour, is ever prepared
      for it. He that is hanged in May will eat no flaunes [footnote: Pancakes]
      in midsummer&mdash;so there is the moan made for the old serving-man. But
      whom, pray I, send you on so fair an errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no lack of messengers,&rdquo; answered his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my hand, but there will,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;your castle is but
      poorly manned, considering the watches that you must keep, having this
      charge&mdash;There is the warder, and two others, whom you discarded for
      tampering with Master George; then for the warder's tower, the bailie, the
      donjon&mdash;five men mount each guard, and the rest must sleep for the
      most part in their clothes. To send away another man, were to harass the
      sentinels to death&mdash;unthrifty misuse for a household. To take in new
      soldiers were dangerous, the charge requiring tried men. I see but one
      thing for it&mdash;I will do your errand to Sir William Douglas myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were indeed a resource!&mdash;And on what day within twenty years
      would it be done?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even with the speed of man and horse,&rdquo; said Dryfesdale; &ldquo;for though I
      care not much about the latter days of an old serving-man's life, yet I
      would like to know as soon as may be, whether my neck is mine own or the
      hangman's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holdest thou thy own life so lightly?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Else I had reckoned more of that of others,&rdquo; said the predestinarian&mdash;&ldquo;What
      is death?&mdash;it is but ceasing to live&mdash;And what is living?&mdash;a
      weary return of light and darkness, sleeping and waking, being hungered
      and eating. Your dead man needs neither candle nor can, neither fire nor
      feather-bed; and the joiner's chest serves him for an eternal
      frieze-jerkin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched man! believest thou not that after death comes the judgment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; answered Dryfesdale, &ldquo;as my mistress, I may not dispute your
      words; but, as spiritually speaking, you are still but a burner of bricks
      in Egypt, ignorant of the freedom of the saints; for, as was well shown to
      me by that gifted man, Nicolaus Schoefferbach, who was martyred by the
      bloody Bishop of Munster, he cannot sin who doth but execute that which is
      predestined, since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the Lady, interrupting him,&mdash;&ldquo;Answer me not with thy
      bold and presumptuous blasphemy, but hear me. Thou hast been long the
      servant of our house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The born servant of the Douglas&mdash;they have had the best of me&mdash;I
      served them since I left Lockerbie: I was then ten years old, and you may
      soon add the threescore to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy foul attempt has miscarried, so thou art guilty only in intention. It
      were a deserved deed to hang thee on the warder's tower; and yet in thy
      present mind, it were but giving a soul to Satan. I take thine offer, then&mdash;Go
      hence&mdash;here is my packet&mdash;I will add to it but a line, to desire
      him to send me a faithful servant or two to complete the garrison. Let my
      son deal with you as he will. If thou art wise, thou wilt make for
      Lockerbie so soon as thy foot touches dry land, and let the packet find
      another bearer; at all rates, look it miscarries not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; replied he&mdash;&ldquo;I was born, as I said, the Douglas's
      servant, and I will be no corbie-messenger in mine old age&mdash;your
      message to your son shall be done as truly by me as if it concerned
      another man's neck. I take my leave of your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady issued her commands, and the old man was ferried over to the
      shore, to proceed on his extraordinary pilgrimage. It is necessary the
      reader should accompany him on his journey, which Providence had
      determined should not be of long duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the village, the steward, although his disgrace had
      transpired, was readily accommodated with a horse, by the Chamberlain's
      authority; and the roads being by no means esteemed safe, he associated
      himself with Auchtermuchty, the common carrier, in order to travel in his
      company to Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy waggoner, according to the established customs of all carriers,
      stage-coachmen, and other persons in public authority, from the earliest
      days to the present, never wanted good reasons for stopping upon the road,
      as often as he would; and the place which had most captivation for him as
      a resting-place was a change-house, as it was termed, not very distant
      from a romantic dell, well known by the name of Keirie Craigs. Attractions
      of a kind very different from those which arrested the progress of John
      Auchtermuchty and his wains, still continue to hover round this romantic
      spot, and none has visited its vicinity without a desire to remain long
      and to return soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived near his favourite <i>howss</i>, not all the authority of
      Dryfesdale (much diminished indeed by the rumours of his disgrace) could
      prevail on the carrier, obstinate as the brutes which he drove, to pass on
      without his accustomed halt, for which the distance he had travelled
      furnished little or no pretence. Old Keltie, the landlord, who had
      bestowed his name on a bridge in the neighbourhood of his quondam
      dwelling, received the carrier with his usual festive cordiality, and
      adjourned with him into the house, under pretence of important business,
      which, I believe, consisted in their emptying together a mutchkin stoup of
      usquebaugh. While the worthy host and his guest were thus employed, the
      discarded steward, with a double portion of moroseness in his gesture and
      look, walked discontentedly into the kitchen of the place, which was
      occupied but by one guest. The stranger was a slight figure, scarce above
      the age of boyhood, and in the dress of a page, but bearing an air of
      haughty aristocratic boldness and even insolence in his look and manner,
      that might have made Dryfesdale conclude he had pretensions to superior
      rank, had not his experience taught him how frequently these airs of
      superiority were assumed by the domestics and military retainers of the
      Scottish nobility.&mdash;&ldquo;The pilgrim's morning to you, old sir,&rdquo; said the
      youth; &ldquo;you come, as I think, from Lochleven Castle&mdash;What news of our
      bonny Queen?&mdash;a fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched a
      dovecot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They that speak of Lochleven, and of those whom its walls contain,&rdquo;
       answered Dryfesdale, &ldquo;speak of what concerns the Douglas; and they who
      speak of what concerns the Douglas, do it at their peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you speak from fear of them, old man, or would you make a quarrel for
      them?&mdash;I should have deemed your age might have cooled your blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, while there are empty-pated coxcombs at each corner to keep it
      warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sight of thy gray hairs keeps mine cold,&rdquo; said the boy, who had risen
      up and now sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well for thee, or I had cooled it with this holly-rod,&rdquo; replied the
      steward. &ldquo;I think thou be'st one of those swash-bucklers, who brawl in
      alehouses and taverns; and who, if words were pikes, and oaths were Andrew
      Ferraras, would soon place the religion of Babylon in the land once more,
      and the woman of Moab upon the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by Saint Bennet of Seyton,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;I will strike thee on
      the face, thou foul-mouthed old railing heretic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Bennet of Seyton,&rdquo; echoed the steward; &ldquo;a proper warrant is Saint
      Bennet's, and for a proper nest of wolf-birds like the Seytons!&mdash;I
      will arrest thee as a traitor to King James and the good Regent.&mdash;Ho!
      John Auchtermuchty, raise aid against the King's traitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he laid his hand on the youth's collar, and drew his sword.
      John Auchtermuchty looked in, but, seeing the naked weapon, ran faster out
      than he entered. Keltie, the landlord, stood by and helped neither party,
      only exclaiming, &ldquo;Gentlemen! gentlemen! for the love of Heaven!&rdquo; and so
      forth. A struggle ensued, in which the young man, chafed at Dryfesdale's
      boldness, and unable, with the ease he expected, to extricate himself from
      the old man's determined grasp, drew his dagger, and with the speed of
      light, dealt him three wounds in the breast and body, the least of which
      was mortal. The old man sunk on the ground with a deep groan, and the host
      set up a piteous exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, ye brawling hound!&rdquo; said the wounded steward; &ldquo;are dagger-stabs
      and dying men such rarities in Scotland, that you should cry as if the
      house were falling?&mdash;Youth, I do not forgive thee, for there is
      nought betwixt us to forgive. Thou hast done what I have done to more than
      one&mdash;And I suffer what I have seen them suffer&mdash;it was all
      ordained to be thus and not otherwise. But if thou wouldst do me right,
      thou wilt send this packet safely to the hands of Sir William Douglas; and
      see that my memory suffer not, as if I would have loitered on mine errand
      for fear of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth, whose passion had subsided the instant he had done the deed,
      listened with sympathy and attention, when another person, muffled in his
      cloak, entered the apartment, and exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Good God! Dryfesdale,
      and expiring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and Dryfesdale would that he had been dead,&rdquo; answered the wounded
      man, &ldquo;rather than that his ears had heard the words of the only Douglas
      that ever was false&mdash;but yet it is better as it is. Good my murderer,
      and the rest of you, stand back a little, and let me speak with this
      unhappy apostate.&mdash;Kneel down by me, Master George&mdash;You have
      heard that I failed in my attempt to take away that Moabitish
      stumbling-block and her retinue&mdash;I gave them that which I thought
      would have removed the temptation out of thy path&mdash;and this, though I
      had other reasons to show to thy mother and others, I did chiefly purpose
      for love of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of me, base poisoner!&rdquo; answered Douglas, &ldquo;wouldst thou have
      committed so horrible, so unprovoked a murder, and mentioned my name with
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore not, George of Douglas?&rdquo; answered Dryfesdale. &ldquo;Breath is
      now scarce with me, but I would spend my last gasp on this argument. Hast
      thou not, despite the honour thou owest to thy parents, the faith that is
      due to thy religion, the truth that is due to thy king, been so carried
      away by the charms of this beautiful sorceress, that thou wouldst have
      helped her to escape from her prison-house, and lent her thine arm again
      to ascend the throne, which she had made a place of abomination?&mdash;Nay,
      stir not from me&mdash;my hand, though fast stiffening, has yet force
      enough to hold thee&mdash;What dost thou aim at?&mdash;to wed this witch
      of Scotland?&mdash;I warrant thee, thou mayest succeed&mdash;her heart and
      hand have been oft won at a cheaper rate, than thou, fool that thou art,
      would think thyself happy to pay. But, should a servant of thy father's
      house have seen thee embrace the fate of the idiot Darnley, or of the
      villain Bothwell&mdash;the fate of the murdered fool, or of the living
      pirate&mdash;while an ounce of ratsbane would have saved thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think on God, Dryfesdale,&rdquo; said George Douglas, &ldquo;and leave the utterance
      of those horrors&mdash;Repent, if thou canst&mdash;if not, at least be
      silent.&mdash;Seyton, aid me to support this dying wretch, that he may
      compose himself to better thoughts, if it be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seyton!&rdquo; answered the dying man; &ldquo;Seyton! Is it by a Seyton's hand that I
      fall at last?&mdash;There is something of retribution in that&mdash;since
      the house had nigh lost a sister by my deed.&rdquo; Fixing his fading eyes on
      the youth, he added, &ldquo;He hath her very features and presence!&mdash;Stoop
      down, youth, and let me see thee closer&mdash;I would know thee when we
      meet in yonder world, for homicides will herd together there, and I have
      been one.&rdquo; He pulled Seyton's face, in spite of some resistance, closer to
      his own, looked at him fixedly, and added, &ldquo;Thou hast begun young&mdash;thy
      career will be the briefer&mdash;ay, thou wilt be met with, and that anon&mdash;a
      young plant never throve that was watered with an old man's blood.&mdash;Yet
      why blame I thee? Strange turns of fate,&rdquo; he muttered, ceasing to address
      Seyton; &ldquo;I designed what I could not do, and he has done what he did not
      perchance design.&mdash;Wondrous, that our will should ever oppose itself
      to the strong and uncontrollable tide of destiny&mdash;that we should
      strive with the stream when we might drift with the current! My brain will
      serve me to question it no farther&mdash;I would Schoefferbach were here&mdash;yet
      why?&mdash;I am on a course which the vessel can hold without a pilot.&mdash;Farewell,
      George of Douglas&mdash;I die true to thy father's house.&rdquo; He fell into
      convulsions at these words, and shortly after expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seyton and Douglas stood looking on the dying man, and when the scene was
      closed, the former was the first to speak. &ldquo;As I live, Douglas, I meant
      not this, and am sorry; but he laid hands on me, and compelled me to
      defend my freedom, as I best might, with my dagger. If he were ten times
      thy friend and follower, I can but say that I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame thee not, Seyton,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;though I lament the chance.
      There is an overruling destiny above us, though not in the sense in which
      it was viewed by that wretched man, who, beguiled by some foreign
      mystagogue, used the awful word as the ready apology for whatever he chose
      to do&mdash;we must examine the packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They withdrew into an inner room, and remained deep in consultation, until
      they were disturbed by the entrance of Keltie, who, with an embarrassed
      countenance, asked Master George Douglas's pleasure respecting the
      disposal of the body. &ldquo;Your honour knows,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that I make my bread
      by living men, not by dead corpses; and old Mr. Dryfesdale, who was but a
      sorry customer while he was alive, occupies my public room now that he is
      deceased, and can neither call for ale nor brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie a stone round his neck,&rdquo; said Seyton, &ldquo;and when the sun is down, have
      him to the Loch of Ore, heave him in, and let him alone for finding out
      the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under your favour, sir,&rdquo; said George Douglas, &ldquo;it shall not be so.&mdash;Keltie,
      thou art a true fellow to me, and thy having been so shall advantage thee.
      Send or take the body to the chapel at Scotland's wall, or to the church
      of Ballanry, and tell what tale thou wilt of his having fallen in a brawl
      with some unruly guests of thine. Auchtermuchty knows nought else, nor are
      the times so peaceful as to admit close-looking into such accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let him tell the truth,&rdquo; said Seyton, &ldquo;so far as it harms not our
      scheme.&mdash;Say that Henry Seyton met with him, my good fellow;&mdash;I
      care not a brass bodle for the feud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A feud with the Douglas was ever to be feared, however,&rdquo; said George,
      displeasure mingling with his natural deep gravity of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when the best of the name is on my side,&rdquo; replied Seyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Henry, if thou meanest me, I am but half a Douglas in this emprize&mdash;half
      head, half heart, and half hand.&mdash;But I will think on one who can
      never be forgotten, and be all, or more, than any of my ancestors was
      ever.&mdash;Keltie, say it was Henry Seyton did the deed; but beware, not
      a word of me!&mdash;Let Auchtermuchty carry this packet&rdquo; (which he had
      resealed with his own signet) &ldquo;to my father at Edinburgh; and here is to
      pay for the funeral expenses, and thy loss of custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the washing of the floor,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;which will be an
      extraordinary job; for blood they say, will scarcely ever cleanse out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as for your plan,&rdquo; said George of Douglas, addressing Seyton, as if
      in continuation of what they had been before treating of, &ldquo;it has a good
      face; but, under your favour, you are yourself too hot and too young,
      besides other reasons which are much against your playing the part you
      propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will consult the Father Abbot upon it,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;Do you ride
      to Kinross to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;so I purpose,&rdquo; answered Douglas; &ldquo;the night will be dark, and
      suits a muffled man. [Footnote: Generally, a disguised man; originally one
      who wears the cloak or mantle muffled round the lower part of the face to
      conceal his countenance. I have on an ancient, piece of iron the
      representation of a robber thus accoutred, endeavouring to make his way
      into a house, and opposed by a mastiff, to whom he in vain offers food.
      The motto is <i>spernit dona fides</i>. It is part of a fire-grate said to
      have belonged to Archbishop Sharpe.]&mdash;Keltie, I forgot, there should
      be a stone laid on that man's grave, recording his name, and his only
      merit, which was being a faithful servant to the Douglas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What religion was the man of?&rdquo; said Seyton; &ldquo;he used words, which make me
      fear I have sent Satan a subject before his time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you little of that,&rdquo; said George Douglas; &ldquo;he was noted for
      disliking both Rome and Geneva, and spoke of lights he had learned among
      the fierce sectaries of Lower Germany&mdash;an evil doctrine it was, if we
      judge by the fruits. God keep us from presumptuously judging of Heaven's
      secrets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said the young Seyton, &ldquo;and from meeting any encounter this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not thy wont to pray so,&rdquo; said George Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I leave that to you,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;when you are seized with
      scruples of engaging with your father's vassals. But I would fain have
      this old man's blood off these hands of mine ere I shed more&mdash;I will
      confess to the Abbot to-night, and I trust to have light penance for
      ridding the earth of such a miscreant. All I sorrow for is, that he was
      not a score of years younger&mdash;He drew steel first, however, that is
      one comfort.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ay, Pedro,&mdash;Come you here with mask and lantern.
  Ladder of ropes and other moonshine tools&mdash;
  Why, youngster, thou mayst cheat the old Duenna,
  Flatter the waiting-woman, bribe the valet;
  But know, that I her father play the Gryphon,

                             THE SPANISH FATHER.
</pre>
    <p>
      The tenor of our tale carries us back to the Castle of Lochleven, where we
      take up the order of events on the same remarkable day on which Dryfesdale
      had been dismissed from the castle. It was past noon, the usual hour of
      dinner, yet no preparations seemed made for the Queen's entertainment.
      Mary herself had retired into her own apartment, where she was closely
      engaged in writing. Her attendants were together in the presence-chamber,
      and much disposed to speculate on the delay of the dinner; for it may be
      recollected that their breakfast had been interrupted. &ldquo;I believe in my
      conscience,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;that having found the poisoning scheme
      miscarry, by having gone to the wrong merchant for their deadly wares,
      they are now about to try how famine will work upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Fleming was somewhat alarmed at this surmise, but comforted herself
      by observing that the chimney of the kitchen had reeked that whole day in
      a manner which contradicted the supposition.&mdash;Catherine Seyton
      presently exclaimed, &ldquo;They were bearing the dishes across the court,
      marshalled by the Lady Lochleven herself, dressed out in her highest and
      stiffest ruff, with her partlet and sleeves of cyprus, and her huge
      old-fashioned farthingale of crimson velvet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe on my word,&rdquo; said the page, approaching the window also, &ldquo;it
      was in that very farthingale that she captivated the heart of gentle King
      Jamie, which procured our poor Queen her precious bargain of a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may hardly be, Master Roland,&rdquo; answered the Lady Fleming, who was a
      great recorder of the changes of fashion, &ldquo;since the farthingales came
      first in when the Queen Regent went to Saint Andrews, after the battle of
      Pinkie, and were then called <i>Vertugardins</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have proceeded farther in this important discussion, but was
      interrupted by the entrance of the Lady of Lochleven, who preceded the
      servants bearing the dishes, and formally discharged the duty of tasting
      each of them. Lady Fleming regretted, in courtly phrase, &ldquo;that the Lady of
      Lochleven should have undertaken so troublesome an office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the strange incident of this day, madam,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;it is
      necessary for my honour and that of my son, that I partake whatever is
      offered to my involuntary guest. Please to inform the Lady Mary that I
      attend her commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Majesty,&rdquo; replied Lady Fleming, with due emphasis on the word, &ldquo;shall
      be informed that the Lady Lochleven waits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary appeared instantly, and addressed her hostess with courtesy, which
      even approached to something more cordial. &ldquo;This is nobly done, Lady
      Lochleven,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;for though we ourselves apprehend no danger under
      your roof, our ladies have been much alarmed by this morning's chance, and
      our meal will be the more cheerful for your presence and assurance. Please
      you to sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Lochleven obeyed the Queen's commands, and Roland performed the
      office of carver and attendant as usual. But, notwithstanding what the
      Queen had said, the meal was silent and unsocial; and every effort which
      Mary made to excite some conversation, died away under the solemn and
      chill replies of the Lady of Lochleven. At length it became plain that the
      Queen, who had considered these advances as a condescension on her part,
      and who piqued herself justly on her powers of pleasing, became offended
      at the repulsive conduct of her hostess. After looking with a significant
      glance at Lady Fleming and Catherine, she slightly shrugged her shoulders,
      and remained silent. A pause ensued, at the end of which the Lady Douglas
      spoke:&mdash;&ldquo;I perceive, madam, I am a check on the mirth of this fair
      company. I pray you to excuse me&mdash;I am a widow&mdash;alone here in a
      most perilous charge&mdash;-deserted by my grandson&mdash;betrayed by my
      servant&mdash;I am little worthy of the grace you do me in offering me a
      seat at your table, where I am aware that wit and pastime are usually
      expected from the guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Lady Lochleven is serious,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;we wonder by what
      simplicity she expects our present meals to be seasoned with mirth. If she
      is a widow, she lives honoured and uncontrolled, at the head of her late
      husband's household. But I know at least of one widowed woman in the
      world, before whom the words desertion and betrayal ought never to be
      mentioned, since no one has been made so bitterly acquainted with their
      import.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant not, madam, to remind you of your misfortunes, by the mention of
      mine,&rdquo; answered the Lady Lochleven, and there was again a deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary at length addressed Lady Fleming. &ldquo;We can commit no deadly sins here,
      <i>ma bonne</i>, where we are so well warded and looked to; but if we
      could, this Carthusian silence might be useful as a kind of penance. If
      thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss, my Fleming, or if Catherine hath made
      a wry stitch in her broidery, when she was thinking of something else than
      her work, or if Roland Graeme hath missed a wild-duck on the wing, and
      broke a quarrel-pane [Footnote: Diamond-shaped; literally, formed like the
      head of a <i>quarrel</i>, or arrow for the crossbow.] of glass in the
      turret window, as chanced to him a week since, now is the time to think on
      your sins and to repent of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I speak with all reverence,&rdquo; said the Lady Lochleven; &ldquo;but I am
      old, and claim the privilege of age. Methinks your followers might find
      fitter subjects for repentance than the trifles you mention, and so
      mention&mdash;once more, I crave your pardon&mdash;as if you jested with
      sin and repentance both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been our taster, Lady Lochleven,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I perceive
      you would eke out your duty with that of our Father Confessor&mdash;and
      since you choose that our conversation should be serious, may I ask you
      why the Regent's promise&mdash;since your son so styles himself&mdash;has
      not been kept to me in that respect? From time to time this promise has
      been renewed, and as constantly broken. Methinks those who pretend
      themselves to so much gravity and sanctity, should not debar from others
      the religious succours which their consciences require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, the Earl of Murray was indeed weak enough,&rdquo; said the Lady
      Lochleven, &ldquo;to give so far way to your unhappy prejudices, and a
      religioner of the Pope presented himself on his part at our town of
      Kinross. But the Douglass is Lord of his own castle, and will not permit
      his threshold to be darkened, no not for a single moment, by an emissary
      belonging to the Bishop of Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks it were well, then,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;that my Lord Regent would send
      me where there is less scruple and more charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this, madam,&rdquo; answered the Lady Lochleven, &ldquo;you mistake the nature
      both of charity and of religion. Charity giveth to those who are in
      delirium the medicaments which may avail their health, but refuses those
      enticing cates and liquors which please the palate, but augment the
      disease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This your charity, Lady Lochleven, is pure cruelty, under the
      hypocritical disguise of friendly care. I am oppressed amongst you as if
      you meant the destruction both of my body and soul; but Heaven will not
      endure such iniquity for ever, and they who are the most active agents in
      it may speedily expect their reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Randal entered the apartment, with a look so much
      perturbed, that the Lady Fleming uttered a faint scream, the Queen was
      obviously startled, and the Lady of Lochleven, though too bold and proud
      to evince any marked signs of alarm, asked hastily what was the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dryfesdale has been slain, madam,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;murdered as soon as he
      gained the dry land by young Master Henry Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Catherine's turn to start and grow pale&mdash;&ldquo;Has the murderer
      of the Douglas's vassal escaped?&rdquo; was the Lady's hasty question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was none to challenge him but old Keltie, and the carrier
      Auchtermuchty,&rdquo; replied Randal; &ldquo;unlikely men to stay one of the frackest
      [Footnote: Boldest&mdash;most forward.] youths in Scotland of his years,
      and who was sure to have friends and partakers at no great distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the deed completed?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done, and done thoroughly,&rdquo; said Randal; &ldquo;a Seyton seldom strikes twice&mdash;But
      the body was not despoiled, and your honour's packet goes forward to
      Edinburgh by Auchtermuchty, who leaves Keltie-Bridge early to-morrow&mdash;marry,
      he has drunk two bottles of aquavitae to put the fright out of his head,
      and now sleeps them off beside his cart-avers.&rdquo; [Footnote: Cart-horses.]
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause when this fatal tale was told. The Queen and Lady
      Douglas looked on each other, as if each thought how she could best turn
      the incident to her own advantage in the controversy, which was
      continually kept alive betwixt them&mdash;Catherine Seyton kept her
      kerchief at her eyes and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, madam, the bloody maxims and practice of the deluded Papists,&rdquo;
       said Lady Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;say rather you see the deserved judgment
      of Heaven upon a Calvinistical poisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dryfesdale was not of the Church of Geneva, or of Scotland,&rdquo; said the
      Lady of Lochleven, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a heretic, however,&rdquo; replied Mary; &ldquo;there is but one true and
      unerring guide; the others lead alike into error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam, I trust it will reconcile you to your retreat, that this
      deed shows the temper of those who might wish you at liberty.
      Blood-thirsty tyrants, and cruel men-quellers are they all, from the
      Clan-Ranald and Clan-Tosach in the north, to the Ferniherst and Buccleuch
      in the south&mdash;the murdering Seytons in the east, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, madam, you forget that I am a Seyton?&rdquo; said Catherine,
      withdrawing her kerchief from her face, which was now coloured with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had forgot it, fair mistress, your forward bearing would have
      reminded me,&rdquo; said Lady Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my brother has slain the villain that would have poisoned his
      Sovereign, and his sister,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;I am only so far sorry that
      he should have spared the hangman his proper task. For aught farther, had
      it been the best Douglas in the land, he would have been honoured in
      falling by the Seyton's sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, gay mistress,&rdquo; said the Lady of Lochleven, rising to withdraw;
      &ldquo;it is such maidens as you, who make giddy-fashioned revellers and deadly
      brawlers. Boys must needs rise, forsooth, in the grace of some sprightly
      damsel, who thinks to dance through life as through a French galliard.&rdquo;
       She then made her reverence to the Queen, and added, &ldquo;Do you also, madam,
      fare you well, till curfew time, when I will make, perchance, more bold
      than welcome in attending upon your supper board.&mdash;Come with me,
      Randal, and tell me more of this cruel fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis an extraordinary chance,&rdquo; said the Queen, when she had departed;
      &ldquo;and, villain as he was, I would this man had been spared time for
      repentance. We will cause something to be done for his soul, if we ever
      attain our liberty, and the Church will permit such grace to a heretic.&mdash;But,
      tell me, Catherine, <i>ma mignóne</i>&mdash;this brother of thine, who is
      so <i>frack</i>, as the fellow called him, bears he the same wonderful
      likeness to thee as formerly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Grace means in temper, you know whether I am so <i>frack</i> as
      the serving-man spoke him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, thou art prompt enough in all reasonable conscience,&rdquo; replied the
      Queen; &ldquo;but thou art my own darling notwithstanding&mdash;But I meant, is
      this thy twin-brother as like thee in form and features as formerly? I
      remember thy dear mother alleged it as a reason for destining thee to the
      veil, that, were ye both to go at large, thou wouldst surely get the
      credit of some of thy brother's mad pranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, madam,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;there are some unusually simple
      people even yet, who can hardly distinguish betwixt us, especially when,
      for diversion's sake, my brother hath taken a female dress,&rdquo;&mdash;and as
      she spoke, she gave a quick glance at Roland Graeme, to whom this
      conversation conveyed a ray of light, welcome as ever streamed into the
      dungeon of a captive through the door which opened to give him freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a handsome cavalier this brother of thine, if he be so like
      you,&rdquo; replied Mary. &ldquo;He was in France, I think, for these late years, so
      that I saw him not at Holyrood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His looks, madam, have never been much found fault with,&rdquo; answered
      Catherine Seyton; &ldquo;but I would he had less of that angry and heady spirit
      which evil times have encouraged amongst our young nobles. God knows, I
      grudge not his life in your Grace's quarrel; and love him for the
      willingness with which he labours for your rescue. But wherefore should he
      brawl with an old ruffianly serving-man, and stain at once his name with
      such a broil, and his hands with the blood of an old and ignoble wretch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, be patient, Catherine; I will not have thee traduce my gallant young
      knight. With Henry for my knight, and Roland Graeme for my trusty squire,
      methinks I am like a princess of romance, who may shortly set at defiance
      the dungeons and the weapons of all wicked sorcerers.&mdash;But my head
      aches with the agitation of the day. Take me <i>La Mer Des Histoires</i>,
      and resume where we left off on Wednesday.&mdash;Our Lady help thy head,
      girl, or rather may she help thy heart!&mdash;I asked thee for the Sea of
      Histories, and thou hast brought <i>La Cronique d'Amour</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once embarked upon the Sea of Histories, the Queen continued her labours
      with her needle, while Lady Fleming and Catherine read to her alternately
      for two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Roland Graeme, it is probable that he continued in secret intent
      upon the Chronicle of Love, notwithstanding the censure which the Queen
      seemed to pass upon that branch of study. He now remembered a thousand
      circumstances of voice and manner, which, had his own prepossession been
      less, must surely have discriminated the brother from the sister; and he
      felt ashamed, that, having as it were by heart every particular of
      Catherine's gestures, words, and manners, he should have thought her,
      notwithstanding her spirits and levity, capable of assuming the bold step,
      loud tones, and forward assurance, which accorded well enough with her
      brother's hasty and masculine character. He endeavoured repeatedly to
      catch a glance of Catherine's eye, that he might judge how she was
      disposed to look upon him since he had made the discovery, but he was
      unsuccessful; for Catherine, when she was not reading herself, seemed to
      take so much interest in the exploits of the Teutonic knights against the
      Heathens of Esthonia and Livonia, that he could not surprise her eye even
      for a second. But when, closing the book, the Queen commanded their
      attendance in the garden, Mary, perhaps of set purpose, (for Roland's
      anxiety could not escape so practised an observer,) afforded him a
      favourable opportunity of accosting his mistress. The Queen commanded them
      to a little distance, while she engaged Lady Fleming in a particular and
      private conversation; the subject whereof we learn, from another
      authority, to have been the comparative excellence of the high standing
      ruff and the falling band. Roland must have been duller, and more sheepish
      than ever was youthful lover, if he had not endeavoured to avail himself
      of this opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been longing this whole evening to ask of you, fair Catherine,&rdquo;
       said the page, &ldquo;how foolish and unapprehensive you must have thought me,
      in being capable to mistake betwixt your brother and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circumstance does indeed little honour to my rustic manners,&rdquo; said
      Catherine, &ldquo;since those of a wild young man were so readily mistaken for
      mine. But I shall grow wiser in time; and with that view I am determined
      not to think of your follies, but to correct my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the lighter subject of meditation of the two,&rdquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not that,&rdquo; said Catherine, very gravely; &ldquo;I fear we have been both
      unpardonably foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been mad,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;unpardonably mad. But you, lovely
      Catherine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Catherine, in the same tone of unusual gravity, &ldquo;have too long
      suffered you to use such expressions towards me&mdash;I fear I can permit
      it no longer, and I blame myself for the pain it may give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can have happened so suddenly to change our relation to each
      other, or alter, with such sudden cruelty, your whole deportment to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly tell,&rdquo; replied Catherine, &ldquo;unless it is that the events of
      the day have impressed on my mind the necessity of our observing more
      distance to each other. A chance similar to that which betrayed to you the
      existence of my brother, may make known to Henry the terms you have used
      to me; and, alas! his whole conduct, as well as his deed, this day, makes
      me too justly apprehensive of the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing for that, fair Catherine,&rdquo; answered the page; &ldquo;I am well
      able to protect myself against risks of that nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;that you would fight with my twin-brother
      to show your regard for his sister? I have heard the Queen say, in her sad
      hours, that men are, in love or in hate, the most selfish animals of
      creation; and your carelessness in this matter looks very like it. But be
      not so much abashed&mdash;you are no worse than others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me injustice, Catherine,&rdquo; replied the page, &ldquo;I thought but of
      being threatened with a sword, and did not remember in whose hand your
      fancy had placed it. If your brother stood before me, with his drawn
      weapon in his hand, so like as he is to you in word, person, and favour,
      he might shed my life's blood ere I could find in my heart to resist him
      to his injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is not my brother alone. But you remember only the
      singular circumstances in which we have met in equality, and I may say in
      intimacy. You think not, that whenever I re-enter my father's house, there
      is a gulf between us you may not pass, but with peril of your life.&mdash;Your
      only known relative is of wild and singular habits, of a hostile and
      broken clan [Footnote: A broken clan was one who had no chief able to find
      security for their good behaviour&mdash;a clan of outlaws; And the Graemes
      of the Debateable Land were in that condition.]&mdash;the rest of your
      lineage unknown&mdash;forgive me that I speak what is the undeniable
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, my beautiful Catherine, despises genealogies,&rdquo; answered Roland
      Graeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love may, but so will not the Lord Seyton,&rdquo; rejoined the damsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen, thy mistress and mine, she will intercede. Oh! drive me not
      from you at the moment I thought myself most happy!&mdash;and if I shall
      aid her deliverance, said not yourself that you and she would become my
      debtors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Scotland will become your debtors,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;but for the
      active effects you might hope from our gratitude, you must remember I am
      wholly subjected to my father; and the poor Queen is, for a long time,
      more likely to be dependant on the pleasure of the nobles of her party,
      than possessed of power to control them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Roland; &ldquo;my deeds shall control prejudice itself&mdash;it
      is a bustling world, and I will have my share. The Knight of Avenel, high
      as he now stands, rose from as obscure an origin as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;there spoke the doughty knight of romance, that
      will cut his way to the imprisoned princess, through fiends and fiery
      dragons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I can set the princess at large, and procure her the freedom of
      her own choice,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;where, dearest Catherine, will that
      choice alight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release the princess from duresse, and she will tell you,&rdquo; said the
      damsel; and breaking off the conversation abruptly, she joined the Queen
      so suddenly, that Mary exclaimed, half aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more tidings of evil import&mdash;no dissension, I trust, in my
      limited household?&rdquo;&mdash;Then looking on Catherine's blushing cheek, and
      Roland's expanded brow and glancing eye&mdash;&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      see all is well&mdash;<i>Ma petite mignone</i>, go to my apartment and
      fetch me down&mdash;let me see&mdash;ay, fetch my pomander box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having thus disposed of her attendant in the manner best qualified to
      hide her confusion, the Queen added, speaking apart to Roland, &ldquo;I should
      at least have two grateful subjects of Catherine and you; for what
      sovereign but Mary would aid true love so willingly?&mdash;Ay, you lay
      your hand on your sword&mdash;your <i>petite flamberge à rien</i> there&mdash;Well,
      short time will show if all the good be true that is protested to us&mdash;I
      hear them toll curfew from Kinross. To our chamber&mdash;this old dame
      hath promised to be with us again at our evening meal. Were it not for the
      hope of speedy deliverance, her presence would drive me distracted. But I
      will be patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I profess,&rdquo; said Catherine, who just then entered, &ldquo;I would I could be
      Henry, with all a man's privileges, for one moment&mdash;I long to throw
      my plate at that confect of pride and formality, and ill-nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Fleming reprimanded her young companion for this explosion of
      impatience; the Queen laughed, and they went to the presence-chamber,
      where almost immediately entered supper, and the Lady of the castle. The
      Queen, strong in her prudent resolutions, endured her presence with great
      fortitude and equanimity, until her patience was disturbed by a new form,
      which had hitherto made no part of the ceremonial of the castle. When the
      other attendant had retired, Randal entered, bearing the keys of the
      castle fastened upon a chain, and, announcing that the watch was set, and
      the gates locked, delivered the keys with all reverence to the Lady of
      Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen and her ladies exchanged with each other a look of
      disappointment, anger, and vexation; and Mary said aloud, &ldquo;We cannot
      regret the smallness of our court, when we see our hostess discharge in
      person so many of its offices. In addition to her charges of principal
      steward of our household and grand almoner, she has to-night done duty as
      captain of our guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will continue to do so in future, madam,&rdquo; answered the Lady
      Lochleven, with much gravity; &ldquo;the history of Scotland may teach me how
      ill the duty is performed, which is done by an accredited deputy&mdash;We
      have heard, madam, of favourites of later date, and as little merit, as
      Oliver Sinclair.&rdquo; [Footnote: A favourite, and said to be an unworthy one,
      of James V.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madam,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;my father had his female as well as his
      male favourites&mdash;there were the Ladies Sandilands and Olifaunt,
      [Footnote: The names of these ladies, and a third frail favourite of
      James, are preserved in an epigram too <i>gaillard</i> for quotation.] and
      some others, methinks; but their names cannot survive in the memory of so
      grave a person as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Lochleven looked as if she could have slain the Queen on the
      spot, but commanded her temper and retired from the apartment, bearing in
      her hand the ponderous bunch of keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now God be praised for that woman's youthful frailty!&rdquo; said the Queen.
      &ldquo;Had she not that weak point in her character, I might waste my words on
      her in vain&mdash;But that stain is the very reverse of what is said of
      the witch's mark&mdash;I can make her feel there, though she is otherwise
      insensible all over.&mdash;But how say you, girls&mdash;here is a new
      difficulty&mdash;How are these keys to be come by?&mdash;there is no
      deceiving or bribing this dragon, I trow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I crave to know,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;whether, if your Grace were beyond
      the walls of the castle, you could find means of conveyance to the firm
      land, and protection when you are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust us for that, Roland,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;for to that point our scheme
      is indifferent well laid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if your Grace will permit me to speak my mind, I think I could be of
      some use in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how, my good youth?&mdash;speak on,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;and fearlessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My patron the Knight of Avenel used to compel the youth educated in his
      household to learn the use of axe and hammer, and working in wood and iron&mdash;he
      used to speak of old northern champions, who forged their own weapons, and
      of the Highland Captain, Donald nan Ord, or Donald of the Hammer, whom he
      himself knew, and who used to work at the anvil with a sledge-hammer in
      each hand. Some said he praised this art, because he was himself of
      churl's blood. However, I gained some practice in it, as the Lady
      Catherine Seyton partly knows; for since we were here, I wrought her a
      silver brooch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied Catharine, &ldquo;but you should tell her Grace that your
      workmanship was so indifferent that it broke to pieces next day, and I
      flung it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe her not, Roland,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;she wept when it was broken,
      and put the fragments into her bosom. But for your scheme&mdash;could your
      skill avail to forge a second set of keys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, because I know not the wards. But I am convinced I could make
      a set so like that hateful bunch which the Lady bore off even now, that
      could they be exchanged against them by any means, she would never dream
      she was possessed of the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the good dame, thank Heaven, is somewhat blind,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;but
      then for a forge, my boy, and the means of labouring unobserved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The armourer's forge, at which I used sometimes to work with him, is the
      round vault at the bottom of the turret&mdash;he was dismissed with the
      warder for being supposed too much attached to George Douglas. The people
      are accustomed to see me work there, and I warrant I shall find some
      excuse that will pass current with them for putting bellows and anvil to
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scheme has a promising face,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;about it, my lad, with
      all speed, and beware the nature of your work is not discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I will take the liberty to draw the bolt against chance visitors, so
      that I will have time to put away what I am working upon, before I undo
      the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not that of itself attract suspicion, in a place where it is so
      current already?&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit,&rdquo; replied Roland; &ldquo;Gregory the armourer, and every good
      hammerman, locks himself in when he is about some master piece of craft.
      Besides, something must be risked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part we then to-night,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;and God bless you my children!&mdash;If
      Mary's head ever rises above water, you shall all rise along with her.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The enterprise of Roland Graeme appeared to prosper. A trinket or two, of
      which the work did not surpass the substance, (for the materials were
      silver, supplied by the Queen,) were judiciously presented to those most
      likely to be inquisitive into the labours of the forge and anvil, which
      they thus were induced to reckon profitable to others and harmless in
      itself. Openly, the page was seen working about such trifles. In private,
      he forged a number of keys resembling so nearly in weight and in form
      those which were presented every evening to the Lady Lochleven, that, on a
      slight inspection, it would have been difficult to perceive the
      difference. He brought them to the dark rusty colour by the use of salt
      and water; and, in the triumph of his art, presented them at length to
      Queen Mary in her presence-chamber, about an hour before the tolling of
      the curfew. She looked at them with pleasure, but at the same time with
      doubt.&mdash;&ldquo;I allow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the Lady Lochleven's eyes, which
      are not of the clearest, may be well deceived, could we pass those keys on
      her in place of the real implements of her tyranny. But how is this to be
      done, and which of my little court dare attempt this <i>tour de jongleur</i>
      with any chance of success? Could we but engage her in some earnest matter
      of argument&mdash;but those which I hold with her, always have been of a
      kind which make her grasp her keys the faster, as if she said to herself&mdash;Here
      I hold what sets me above your taunts and reproaches&mdash;And even for
      her liberty, Mary Stuart could not stoop to speak the proud heretic fair.&mdash;What
      shall we do? Shall Lady Fleming try her eloquence in describing the last
      new head-tire from Paris?&mdash;alas! the good dame has not changed the
      fashion of her head-gear since Pinkie-field for aught that I know. Shall
      my <i>mignóne</i> Catherine sing to her one of those touching airs, which
      draw the very souls out of me and Roland Graeme?&mdash;Alas! Dame Margaret
      Douglas would rather hear a Huguenot psalm of Clement Marrot, sung to the
      tune of <i>Reveillez vous, belle endormie.</i>&mdash;Cousins and liege
      counsellors, what is to be done, for our wits are really astray in this
      matter?&mdash;Must our man-at-arms and the champion of our body, Roland
      Graeme, manfully assault the old lady, and take the keys from her <i>par
      voie du fait?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! with your Grace's permission.&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;I do not doubt being
      able to manage the matter with more discretion; for though, in your
      Grace's service, I do not fear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A host of old women,&rdquo; interrupted Catherine, &ldquo;each armed with rock and
      spindle, yet he has no fancy for pikes and partisans, which might rise at
      the cry of <i>Help! a Douglas, a Douglas!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They that do not fear fair ladies' tongues,&rdquo; continued the page, &ldquo;need
      dread nothing else.&mdash;But, gracious Liege, I am well-nigh satisfied
      that I could pass the exchange of these keys on the Lady Lochleven; but I
      dread the sentinel who is now planted nightly in the garden, which, by
      necessity, we must traverse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our last advices from our friends on the shore have promised us
      assistance in that matter,&rdquo; replied the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is your Grace well assured of the fidelity and watchfulness of those
      without?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For their fidelity, I will answer with my life, and for their vigilance,
      I will answer with my life&mdash;I will give thee instant proof, my
      faithful Roland, that they are ingenuous and trusty as thyself. Come
      hither&mdash;Nay, Catherine, attend us; we carry not so deft a page into
      our private chamber alone. Make fast the door of the parlour, Fleming, and
      warn us if you hear the least step&mdash;or stay, go thou to the door,
      Catherine,&rdquo; (in a whisper, &ldquo;thy ears and thy wits are both sharper.)&mdash;Good
      Fleming, attend us thyself&rdquo;&mdash;(and again she whispered, &ldquo;her reverend
      presence will be as safe a watch on Roland as thine can&mdash;so be not
      jealous, <i>mignone</i>.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, they were lighted by the Lady Fleming into the Queen's
      bedroom, a small apartment enlightened by a projecting window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look from that window, Roland,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;see you amongst the several
      lights which begin to kindle, and to glimmer palely through the gray of
      the evening from the village of Kinross-seest thou, I say, one solitary
      spark apart from the others, and nearer it seems to the verge of the
      water?&mdash;It is no brighter at this distance than the torch of the poor
      glowworm, and yet, my good youth, that light is more dear to Mary Stuart,
      than every star that twinkles in the blue vault of heaven. By that signal,
      I know that more than one true heart is plotting my deliverance; and
      without that consciousness, and the hope of freedom it gives me, I had
      long since stooped to my fate, and died of a broken heart. Plan after plan
      has been formed and abandoned, but still the light glimmers; and while it
      glimmers, my hope lives.&mdash;Oh! how many evenings have I sat musing in
      despair over our ruined schemes, and scarce hoping that I should again see
      that blessed signal; when it has suddenly kindled, and, like the lights of
      Saint Elmo in a tempest, brought hope and consolation, where there, was
      only dejection and despair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I mistake not,&rdquo; answered Roland, &ldquo;the candle shines from the house of
      Blinkhoolie, the mail-gardener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast a good eye,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;it is there where my trusty
      lieges&mdash;God and the saints pour blessings on them!&mdash;hold
      consultation for my deliverance. The voice of a wretched captive would die
      on these blue waters, long ere it could mingle in their councils; and yet
      I can hold communication&mdash;I will confide the whole to thee&mdash;I am
      about to ask those faithful friends if the moment for the great attempt is
      nigh.&mdash;Place the lamp in the window, Fleming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, and immediately withdrew it. No sooner had she done so, than
      the light in the cottage of the gardener disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now count,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, &ldquo;for my heart beats so thick that I cannot
      count myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Fleming began deliberately to count one, two, three, and when she
      had arrived at ten, the light on the shore showed its pale twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, our Lady be praised!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;it was but two nights since,
      that the absence of the light remained while I could tell thirty. The hour
      of deliverance approaches. May God bless those who labour in it with such
      truth to me!&mdash;alas! with such hazard to themselves&mdash;and bless
      you, too, my children!&mdash;Come, we must to the audience-chamber again.
      Our absence might excite suspicion, should they serve supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the presence-chamber, and the evening concluded as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, at dinner-time, an unusual incident occurred. While Lady
      Douglas of Lochleven performed her daily duty of assistant and taster at
      the Queen's table, she was told a man-at-arms had arrived, recommended by
      her son, but without any letter or other token than what he brought by
      word of mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath he given you that token?&rdquo; demanded the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He reserved it, as I think, for your Ladyship's ear,&rdquo; replied Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doth well,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;tell him to wait in the hall&mdash;But no&mdash;with
      your permission, madam,&rdquo; (to the Queen) &ldquo;let him attend me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are pleased to receive your domestics in my presence,&rdquo; said the
      Queen, &ldquo;I cannot choose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My infirmities must plead my excuse, madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady; &ldquo;the life
      I must lead here ill suits with the years which have passed over my head,
      and compels me to waive ceremonial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good Lady,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;I would there were nought in this
      your castle more strongly compulsive than the cobweb chains of ceremony;
      but bolts and bars are harder matters to contend with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the person announced by Randal entered the room, and Roland
      Graeme at once recognized in him the Abbot Ambrosius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, good fellow?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Glendinning,&rdquo; answered the Abbot, with a suitable reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou of the blood of the Knight of Avenel?&rdquo; said the Lady of
      Lochleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam, and that nearly,&rdquo; replied the pretended soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is likely enough,&rdquo; said the Lady, &ldquo;for the Knight is the son of his
      own good works, and has risen from obscure lineage to his present high
      rank in the Estate&mdash;But he is of sure truth and approved worth, and
      his kinsman is welcome to us. You hold, unquestionably, the true faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not doubt of it, madam,&rdquo; said the disguised churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou a token to me from Sir William Douglas?&rdquo; said the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, madam,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but it must be said in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said the Lady, moving towards the recess of a window;
      &ldquo;say in what does it consist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the words of an old bard,&rdquo; replied the Abbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat them,&rdquo; answered the Lady; and he uttered, in a low tone, the lines
      from an old poem, called The Howlet,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O Douglas! Douglas!
  Tender and true.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trusty Sir John Holland!&rdquo; [Footnote: Sir John Holland's poem of the
      Howlet is known to collectors by the beautiful edition presented to the
      Bannatyne Club, by Mr. David Laing.] said the Lady Douglas, apostrophizing
      the poet, &ldquo;a kinder heart never inspired a rhyme, and the Douglas's honour
      was ever on thy heart-string! We receive you among our followers,
      Glendinning&mdash;But, Randal, see that he keep the outer ward only, till
      we shall hear more touching him from our son.&mdash;Thou fearest not the
      night air. Glendinning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the cause of the Lady before whom I stand, I fear nothing, madam,&rdquo;
       answered the disguised Abbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our garrison, then, is stronger by one trustworthy soldier,&rdquo; said the
      matron&mdash;&ldquo;Go to the buttery, and let them make much of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Lady Lochleven had retired, the Queen said to Roland Graeme, who
      was now almost constantly in her company, &ldquo;I spy comfort in that
      stranger's countenance; I know not why it should be so, but I am well
      persuaded he is a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace's penetration does not deceive you,&rdquo; answered the page; and he
      informed her that the Abbot of St. Mary's himself played the part of the
      newly arrived soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen crossed herself and looked upwards. &ldquo;Unworthy sinner that I am,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;that for my sake a man so holy, and so high in spiritual
      office, should wear the garb of a base sworder, and run the risk of dying
      the death of a traitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven will protect its own servant, madam,&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton; &ldquo;his
      aid would bring a blessing on our undertaking, were it not already blest
      for its own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I admire in my spiritual father,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;was the steady front
      with which he looked on me, without giving the least sign of former
      acquaintance. I did not think the like was possible, since I have ceased
      to believe that Henry was the same person with Catherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But marked you not how astuciously the good father,&rdquo; said the Queen,
      &ldquo;eluded the questions of the woman Lochleven, telling her the very truth,
      which yet she received not as such?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland thought in his heart, that when the truth was spoken for the
      purpose of deceiving, it was little better than a lie in disguise. But it
      was no time to agitate such questions of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the signal from the shore,&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine; &ldquo;my bosom
      tells me we shall see this night two lights instead of one gleam from that
      garden of Eden&mdash;And then, Roland, do you play your part manfully, and
      we will dance on the greensward like midnight fairies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine's conjecture misgave not, nor deceived her. In the evening two
      beams twinkled from the cottage, instead of one; and the page heard, with
      beating heart, that the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel on the
      outside of the castle. When he intimated this news to the Queen, she held
      her hand out to him&mdash;he knelt, and when he raised it to his lips in
      all dutiful homage, he found it was damp and cold as marble. &ldquo;For God's
      sake, madam, droop not now,&mdash;sink not now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call upon our Lady, my Liege,&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming&mdash;&ldquo;call upon
      your tutelar saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the spirits of the hundred kings you are descended from,&rdquo; exclaimed
      the page; &ldquo;in this hour of need, the resolution of a monarch were worth
      the aid of a hundred saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Roland Graeme,&rdquo; said Mary, in a tone of deep despondency, &ldquo;be true to
      me&mdash;many have been false to me. Alas! I have not always been true to
      myself. My mind misgives me that I shall die in bondage, and that this
      bold attempt will cost all our lives. It was foretold me by a soothsayer
      in France, that I should die in prison, and by a violent death, and here
      comes the hour&mdash;Oh, would to God it found me prepared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton, &ldquo;remember you are a Queen. Better we all
      died in bravely attempting to gain our freedom, than remained here to be
      poisoned, as men rid them of the noxious vermin that haunt old houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Catherine,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;and Mary will bear her like
      herself. But alas! your young and buoyant spirit can ill spell the causes
      which have broken mine. Forgive me, my children, and farewell for a while&mdash;I
      will prepare both mind and body for this awful venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They separated, till again called together by the tolling of the curfew.
      The Queen appeared grave, but firm and resolved; the Lady Fleming, with
      the art of an experienced courtier, knew perfectly how to disguise her
      inward tremors; Catherine's eye was fired, as if with the boldness of the
      project, and the half smile which dwelt upon her beautiful mouth seemed to
      contemn all the risk and all the consequences of discovery; Roland, who
      felt how much success depended on his own address and boldness, summoned
      together his whole presence of mind, and if he found his spirits flag for
      a moment, cast his eye upon Catherine, whom he thought he had never seen
      look so beautiful.&mdash;&ldquo;I may be foiled,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but with this
      reward in prospect, they must bring the devil to aid them ere they cross
      me.&rdquo; Thus resolved, he stood like a greyhound in the slips, with hand,
      heart, and eye intent upon making and seizing opportunity for the
      execution of their project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keys had, with the wonted ceremonial, been presented to the Lady
      Lochleven. She stood with her back to the casement, which, like that of
      the Queen's apartment, commanded a view of Kinross, with the church, which
      stands at some distance from the town, and nearer to the lake, then
      connected with the town by straggling cottages. With her back to this
      casement, then, and her face to the table, on which the keys lay for an
      instant while she tasted the various dishes which were placed there, stood
      the Lady of Lochleven, more provokingly intent than usual&mdash;so at
      least it seemed to her prisoners&mdash;upon the huge and heavy bunch of
      iron, the implements of their restraint. Just when, having finished her
      ceremony as taster of the Queen's table, she was about to take up the
      keys, the page, who stood beside her, and had handed her the dishes in
      succession, looked sideways to the churchyard, and exclaimed he saw
      corpse-candles in the churchyard. The Lady of Lochleven was not without a
      touch, though a slight one, of the superstitions of the time; the fate of
      her sons made her alive to omens, and a corpse-light, as it was called, in
      the family burial-place boded death. She turned her head towards the
      casement&mdash;saw a distant glimmering&mdash;forgot her charge for one
      second, and in that second were lost the whole fruits of her former
      vigilance. The page held the forged keys under his cloak, and with great
      dexterity exchanged them for the real ones. His utmost address could not
      prevent a slight clash as he took up the latter bunch. &ldquo;Who touches the
      keys?&rdquo; said the Lady; and while the page answered that the sleeve of his
      cloak had stirred them, she looked round, possessed herself of the bunch
      which now occupied the place of the genuine keys, and again turned to gaze
      on the supposed corpse-candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold these gleams,&rdquo; she said, after a moment's consideration, &ldquo;to come,
      not from the churchyard, but from the hut of the old gardener Blinkhoolie.
      I wonder what thrift that churl drives, that of late he hath ever had
      light in his house till the night grew deep. I thought him an industrious,
      peaceful man&mdash;If he turns resetter of idle companions and
      night-walkers, the place must be rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may work his baskets perchance,&rdquo; said the page, desirous to stop the
      train of her suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or nets, may he not?&rdquo; answered the Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;for trout and salmon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or for fools and knaves,&rdquo; replied the Lady: &ldquo;but this shall be looked
      after to-morrow.&mdash;I wish your Grace and your company a good evening.&mdash;Randal,
      attend us.&rdquo; And Randal, who waited in the antechamber after having
      surrendered his bunch of keys, gave his escort to his mistress as usual,
      while, leaving the Queen's apartments, she retired to her own [End of
      paragraph missing in original]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&rdquo; said the page, rubbing his hands with glee as he repeated the
      Lady's last words, &ldquo;fools look to-morrow, and wise folk use to-night.&mdash;May
      I pray you, my gracious Liege, to retire for one half hour, until all the
      castle is composed to rest? I must go and rub with oil these blessed
      implements of our freedom. Courage and constancy, and all will go well,
      provided our friends on the shore fail not to send the boat you spoke of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear them not,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;they are true as steel&mdash;if our dear
      mistress do but maintain her noble and royal courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: In the dangerous expedition to Aberdeenshire, Randolph, the
      English Ambassador, gives Cecil the following account of Queen Mary's
      demeanour:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all those garbulles, I assure your honour, I never saw the Queen
      merrier, never dismayed; nor never thought I that stomache to be in her
      that I find. She repented nothing but, when the Lords and others, at
      Inverness, came in the morning from the watches, that she was not a man,
      to know what life it was to lye all night in the fields, or to walk upon
      the causeway with a jack and a knaps-cap, a Glasgow buckler, and a
      broadsword.&rdquo;&mdash;RANDOLPH <i>to</i> CECIL, <i>September</i> 18, 1562.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer of the above letter seems to have felt the same impression
      which Catherine Seyton, in the text, considered as proper to the Queen's
      presence among her armed subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though we neither thought nor looked for other than on that day to have
      fought or never-what desperate blows would not have been given, when every
      man should have fought in the sight of so noble a Queen, and so many fair
      ladies, our enemies to have taken them from us, and we to save our
      honours, not to be reft of them, your honour can easily judge.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
      same to the same, September</i> 24, 1562. ]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt not me, Catherine,&rdquo; replied the Queen; &ldquo;a while since I was
      overborne, but I have recalled the spirit of my earlier and more sprightly
      days, when I used to accompany my armed nobles, and wish to be myself a
      man, to know what life it was to be in the fields with sword and buckler,
      jack, and knapscap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the lark lives not a gayer life, nor sings a lighter and gayer song
      than the merry soldier,&rdquo; answered Catherine. &ldquo;Your Grace shall be in the
      midst of them soon, and the look of such a liege Sovereign will make each
      of your host worth three in the hour of need:&mdash;but I must to my
      task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have but brief time,&rdquo; said Queen Mary; &ldquo;one of the two lights in the
      cottage is extinguished&mdash;that shows the boat is put off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will row very slow,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;or kent where depth permits, to
      avoid noise.&mdash;To our several tasks&mdash;I will communicate with the
      good Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the dead hour of midnight, when all was silent in the castle, the page
      put the key into the lock of the wicket which opened into the garden, and
      which was at the bottom of a staircase which descended from the Queen's
      apartment. &ldquo;Now, turn smooth and softly, thou good bolt,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
      ever oil softened rust!&rdquo; and his precautions had been so effectual, that
      the bolt revolved with little or no sound of resistance. He ventured not
      to cross the threshold, but exchanging a word with the disguised Abbot,
      asked if the boat were ready?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This half hour,&rdquo; said the sentinel. &ldquo;She lies beneath the wall, too close
      under the islet to be seen by the warder, but I fear she will hardly
      escape his notice in putting off again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darkness,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;and our profound silence, may take her off
      unobserved, as she came in. Hildebrand has the watch on the tower&mdash;a
      heavy-headed knave, who holds a can of ale to be the best headpiece upon a
      night-watch. He sleeps, for a wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then bring the Queen,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;and I will call Henry Seyton to
      assist them to the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On tiptoe, with noiseless step and suppressed breath, trembling at every
      rustle of their own apparel, one after another the fair prisoners glided
      down the winding stair, under the guidance of Roland Graeme, and were
      received at the wicket-gate by Henry Seyton and the churchman. The former
      seemed instantly to take upon himself the whole direction of the
      enterprise. &ldquo;My Lord Abbot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give my sister your arm&mdash;I
      will conduct the Queen&mdash;and that youth will have the honour to guide
      Lady Fleming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was no time to dispute the arrangement, although it was not that
      which Roland Graeme would have chosen. Catherine Seyton, who well knew the
      garden path, tripped on before like a sylph, rather leading the Abbot than
      receiving assistance&mdash;the Queen, her native spirit prevailing over
      female fear, and a thousand painful reflections, moved steadily forward,
      by the assistance of Henry Seyton&mdash;while the Lady Fleming, encumbered
      with her fears and her helplessness Roland Graeme, who followed in the
      rear, and who bore under the other arm a packet of necessaries belonging
      to the Queen. The door of the garden, which communicated with the shore of
      the islet, yielded to one of the keys of which Roland had possessed
      himself, although not until he had tried several,&mdash;a moment of
      anxious terror and expectation. The ladies were then partly led, partly
      carried, to the side of the lake, where a boat with six rowers attended
      them, the men couched along the bottom to secure them from observation.
      Henry Seyton placed the Queen in the stern; the Abbot offered to assist
      Catherine, but she was seated by the Queen's side before he could utter
      his proffer of help; and Roland Graeme was just lifting Lady Fleming over
      the boat-side, when a thought suddenly occurred to him, and exclaiming,
      &ldquo;Forgotten, forgotten! wait for me but one half-minute,&rdquo; he replaced on
      the shore the helpless Lady of the bed-chamber, threw the Queen's packet
      into the boat, and sped back through the garden with the noiseless speed
      of a bird on the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, he is false at last!&rdquo; said Seyton; &ldquo;I ever feared it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is as true,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;as Heaven itself, and that I will
      maintain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, minion,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;for shame, if not for fear&mdash;Fellows,
      put off, and row for your lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me, help me on board!&rdquo; said the deserted Lady Fleming, and that
      louder than prudence warranted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put off&mdash;put off!&rdquo; cried Henry Seyton; &ldquo;leave all behind, so the
      Queen is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you permit this, madam?&rdquo; said Catherine, imploringly; &ldquo;you leave
      your deliverer to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said the Queen.&mdash;&ldquo;Seyton I command you to stay at every
      risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam, if I disobey,&rdquo; said the intractable young man; and with
      one hand lifting in Lady Fleming, he began himself to push off the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was two fathoms' length from the shore, and the rowers were getting
      her head round, when Roland Graeme, arriving, bounded from the beach, and
      attained the boat, overturning Seyton, on whom he lighted. The youth swore
      a deep but suppressed oath, and stopping Graeme as he stepped towards the
      stern, said, &ldquo;Your place is not with high-born dames&mdash;keep at the
      head and trim the vessel&mdash;Now give way&mdash;give way&mdash;Row, for
      God and the Queen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rowers obeyed, and began to pull vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did ye not muffle the oars?&rdquo; said Roland Graeme; &ldquo;the dash must
      awaken the sentinel&mdash;Row, lads, and get out of reach of shot; for had
      not old Hildebrand, the warder, supped upon poppy-porridge, this
      whispering must have waked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all thine own delay,&rdquo; said Seyton; &ldquo;thou shalt reckon, with me
      hereafter for that and other matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Roland's apprehension was verified too instantly to permit him to
      reply. The sentinel, whose slumbering had withstood the whispering, was
      alarmed by the dash of the oars. His challenge was instantly heard. &ldquo;A
      boat&mdash;-a boat!&mdash;bring to, or I shoot!&rdquo; And, as they continued to
      ply their oars, he called aloud, &ldquo;Treason! treason!&rdquo; rung the bell of the
      castle, and discharged his harquebuss at the boat. The ladies crowded on
      each other like startled wild foul, at the flash and report of the piece,
      while the men urged the rowers to the utmost speed. They heard more than
      one ball whiz along the surface of the lake, at no great distance from
      their little bark; and from the lights, which glanced like meteors from
      window to window, it was evident the whole castle was alarmed, and their
      escape discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull!&rdquo; again exclaimed Seyton; &ldquo;stretch to your oars, or I will spur you
      to the task with my dagger&mdash;they will launch a boat immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is cared for,&rdquo; said Roland; &ldquo;I locked gate and wicket on them when I
      went back, and no boat will stir from the island this night, if doors of
      good oak and bolts of iron can keep men within stone-walls.&mdash;And now
      I resign my office of porter of Lochleven, and give the keys to the
      Kelpie's keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the heavy keys plunged in the lake, the Abbot,&mdash;who till then had
      been repeating his prayers, exclaimed, &ldquo;Now, bless thee, my son! for thy
      ready prudence puts shame on us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: It is well known that the escape of Queen Mary from Lochleven
      was effected by George Douglas, the youngest brother of Sir William
      Douglas, the lord of the castle; but the minute circumstances of the event
      have been a good deal confused, owing to two agents having been concerned
      in it who bore the same name. It has been always supposed that George
      Douglas was induced to abet Mary's escape by the ambitions hope that, by
      such service, he might merit her hand. But his purpose was discovered by
      his brother Sir William, and he was expelled from the castle. He
      continued, notwithstanding, to hover in the neighbourhood, and maintain a
      correspondence with the royal prisoner and others in the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we believe the English ambassador Drury, the Queen was grateful to
      George Douglas, and even proposed a marriage with him; a scheme which
      could hardly be serious, since she was still the wife of Bothwell, but
      which, if suggested at all, might be with a purpose of gratifying the
      Regent Murray's ambition, and propitiating his favour; since he was, it
      must be remembered, the brother uterine of George Douglas, for whom such
      high honour was said to be designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal, if seriously made, was treated as inadmissible, and Mary
      again resumed her purpose of escape. Her failure in her first attempt has
      some picturesque particulars, which might have been advantageously
      introduced in fictitious narrative. Drury sends Cecil the following
      account of the matter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after, upon the 25th of the last, (April 1567,) she interprised an
      escape, and was the rather near effect, through her accustomed long lying
      in bed all the morning. The manner of it was thus: there cometh in to her
      the laundress early as other times before she was wanted, and the Queen
      according to such a secret practice putteth on her the hood of the
      laundress, and so with the fardel of clothes and the muffler upon her
      face, passeth, out and entereth the boat to pass the Loch; which, after
      some space, one of them that rowed said merrily, 'Let us see what manner
      of dame this is,' and therewith offered to pull down her muffler, which to
      defend, she put up her hands, which they spied to be very fair and white;
      wherewith they entered into suspicion whom she was, beginning to wonder at
      her enterprise. Whereat she was little dismayed, but charged them, upon
      danger of their lives, to row her over to the shore, which they nothing
      regarded, but eftsoons rowed her back again, promising her it should be
      secreted, and especially from the lord of the house, under whose guard she
      lyeth. It seemeth she knew her refuge, and&mdash;where to have found it if
      she had once landed; for there did, and yet do linger, at a little village
      called Kinross, hard at the Loch side, the same George Douglas, one Sempel
      and one Beton, the which two were sometime her trusty servants, and, as
      yet appeareth, they mind her no less affection.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bishop Keith's
      History of the Affairs of Church and State in Scotland</i>, p. 490.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this disappointment, little spoke of by historians, Mary
      renewed her attempts to escape. There was in the Castle of Lochleven a
      lad, named William Douglas, some relation probably of the baron, and about
      eighteen years old. This youth proved as accessible to Queen Mary's
      prayers and promises, as was the brother of his patron, George Douglas,
      from whom this William must be carefully kept distinct. It was young
      William who played the part commonly assigned to his superior, George,
      stealing the keys of the castle from the table on which they lay, while
      his lord was at supper. He let the Queen and a waiting woman out of the
      apartment where they were secured, and out of the tower itself, embarked
      with them in a small skiff, and rowed them to the shore. To prevent
      instant pursuit, he, for precaution's sake, locked the iron grated door of
      the tower, and threw the keys into the lake. They found George Douglas and
      the Queen's servant, Beton, waiting for them, and Lord Seyton and James
      Hamilton of Orbeiston in attendance, at the head of a party of faithful
      followers, with whom they fled to Niddrie Castle, and from thence to
      Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In narrating this romantic story, both history and tradition confuse the
      two Douglasses together, and confer on George the successful execution of
      the escape from the castle, the merit of which belongs, in reality, to the
      boy called William, or, more frequently, the Little Douglas, either from
      his youth or his slight stature. The reader will observe, that in the
      romance, the part of the Little Douglas has been assigned to Roland
      Graeme. In another case, it would be tedious to point out in a work of
      amusement such minute points of historical fact; but the general interest
      taken in the fate of Queen Mary, renders every thing of consequence which
      connects itself with her misfortunes. ]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; said Mary, drawing her breath more freely, as they were now out
      of reach of the musketry&mdash;&ldquo;I knew my squire's truth, promptitude, and
      sagacity.&mdash;I must have him my dear friends&mdash;with my no less true
      knights, Douglas and Seyton&mdash;but where, then, is Douglas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, madam,&rdquo; answered the deep and melancholy voice of the boatman who
      sat next her, and who acted as steersman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! was it you who stretched your body before me,&rdquo; said the Queen,
      &ldquo;when the balls were raining around us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe you,&rdquo; said he, in a low tone, &ldquo;that Douglas would have resigned
      to any one the chance of protecting his Queen's life with his own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue was here interrupted by a shot or two from one of those small
      pieces of artillery called falconets, then used in defending castles. The
      shot was too vague to have any effect, but the broader flash, the deeper
      sound, the louder return which was made by the midnight echoes of
      Bennarty, terrified and imposed silence on the liberated prisoners. The
      boat was alongside of a rude quay or landing place, running out from a
      garden of considerable extent, ere any of them again attempted to speak.
      They landed, and while the Abbot returned thanks aloud to Heaven,&mdash;which
      had thus far favoured their enterprise, Douglas enjoyed the best reward of
      his desperate undertaking, in conducting the Queen to the house of the
      gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, not unmindful of Roland Graeme even in that moment of terror and
      exhaustion, Mary expressly commanded Seyton to give his assistance to
      Fleming, while Catherine voluntarily, and without bidding, took the arm of
      the page. Seyton presently resigned Lady Fleming to the care of the Abbot,
      alleging, he must look after their horses; and his attendants,
      disencumbering themselves of their boat-cloaks, hastened to assist him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mary spent in the gardener's cottage the few minutes which were
      necessary to prepare the steeds for their departure, she perceived, in a
      corner, the old man to whom the garden belonged, and called him to
      approach. He came as it were with reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;so slow to welcome thy royal Queen and
      mistress to liberty and to her kingdom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, thus admonished, came forward, and, in good terms of speech,
      gave her Grace joy of her deliverance. The Queen returned him thanks in
      the most gracious manner, and added, &ldquo;It will remain to us to offer some
      immediate reward for your fidelity, for we wot well your house has been
      long the refuge in which our trusty servants have met to concert measures
      for our freedom.&rdquo; So saying, she offered gold, and added, &ldquo;We will
      consider your services more fully hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kneel, brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;kneel instantly, and thank her Grace's
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good brother, that wert once a few steps under me, and art still many
      years younger,&rdquo; replied the gardener, pettishly, &ldquo;let me do mine
      acknowledgments in my own way. Queens have knelt to me ere now, and in
      truth my knees are too old and stiff to bend even to this lovely-faced
      lady. May it please your Grace, if your Grace's servants have occupied my
      house, so that I could not call it mine own&mdash;if they have trodden
      down my flowers in the zeal of their midnight comings and goings, and
      destroyed the hope of the fruit season, by bringing their war-horses into
      my garden, I do but crave of your Grace in requital, that you will choose
      your residence as far from me as possible. I am an old man who would
      willingly creep to my grave as easily as I can, in peace, good-will, and
      quiet labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you fairly, good man,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I will not make yonder
      castle my residence again, if I can help it. But let me press on you this
      money&mdash;it will make some amends for the havoc we have made in your
      little garden and orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your Grace, but it will make me not the least amends,&rdquo; said the
      old man. &ldquo;The ruined labours of a whole year are not so easily replaced to
      him who has perchance but that one year to live; and besides, they tell me
      I must leave this place and become a wanderer in mine old age&mdash;I that
      have nothing on earth saving these fruit-trees, and a few old parchments
      and family secrets not worth knowing. As for gold, if I had loved it, I
      might have remained Lord Abbot of St. Mary's&mdash;and yet, I wot not&mdash;for,
      if Abbot Boniface be but the poor peasant Blinkhoolie, his successor, the
      Abbot Ambrosius, is still transmuted for the worse into the guise of a
      sword-and-buckler-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this indeed the Abbot Boniface of whom I have heard?&rdquo; said the Queen.
      &ldquo;It is indeed I who should have bent the knee for your blessing, good
      Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bend no knee to me, Lady! The blessing of an old man, who is no longer an
      Abbot, go with you over dale and down&mdash;I hear the trampling of your
      horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Father,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;When we are once more seated at
      Holyrood, we will neither forget thee nor thine injured garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget us both,&rdquo; said the Ex-Abbot Boniface, &ldquo;and may God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they hurried out of the house, they heard the old man talking and
      muttering to himself, as he hastily drew bolt and bar behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revenge of the Douglasses will reach the poor old man,&rdquo; said the
      Queen. &ldquo;God help me, I ruin every one whom I approach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His safety is cared for,&rdquo; said Seyton; &ldquo;he must not remain here, but will
      be privately conducted to a place of greater security. But I would your
      Grace were in the saddle.&mdash;To horse! to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party of Seyton and of Douglas were increased to about ten by those
      attendants who had remained with the horses. The Queen and her ladies,
      with all the rest who came from the boat, were instantly mounted; and
      holding aloof from the village, which was already alarmed by the firing
      from the castle, with Douglas acting as their guide, they soon reached the
      open ground and began to ride as fast as was consistent with keeping
      together in good order.

      Chapter the Thirty-Sixth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He mounted himself on a coal-black steed,
   And her on a freckled gray,
  With a bugelet horn hung down from his side,
   And roundly they rode away.
                               OLD BALLAD.
</pre>
    <p>
      The influence of the free air, the rushing of the horses over high and
      low, the ringing of the bridles, the excitation at once arising from a
      sense of freedom and of rapid motion, gradually dispelled the confused and
      dejected sort of stupefaction by which Queen Mary was at first
      overwhelmed. She could not at last conceal the change of her feelings to
      the person who rode at her rein, and who she doubted not was the Father
      Ambrosius; for Seyton, with all the heady impetuosity of a youth, proud,
      and justly so, of his first successful adventure, assumed all the bustle
      and importance of commander of the little party, which escorted, in the
      language of the time, the Fortune of Scotland. He now led the van, now
      checked his bounding steed till the rear had come up, exhorted the leaders
      to keep a steady, though rapid pace, and commanded those who were hindmost
      of the party to use their spurs, and allow no interval to take place in
      their line of march; and anon he was beside the Queen, or her ladies,
      inquiring how they brooked the hasty journey, and whether they had any
      commands for him. But while Seyton thus busied himself in the general
      cause with some advantage to the regular order of the march, and a good
      deal of personal ostentation, the horseman who rode beside the Queen gave
      her his full and undivided attention, as if he had been waiting upon some
      superior being. When the road was rugged and dangerous, he abandoned
      almost entirely the care of his own horse, and kept his hand constantly
      upon the Queen's bridle; if a river or larger brook traversed their
      course, his left arm retained her in the saddle, while his right held her
      palfrey's rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought, reverend Father,&rdquo; said the Queen, when they reached
      the other bank, &ldquo;that the convent bred such good horsemen.&rdquo;&mdash;The
      person she addressed sighed, but made no other answer.&mdash;&ldquo;I know not
      how it is,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, &ldquo;but either the sense of freedom, or the
      pleasure of my favourite exercise, from which I have been so long
      debarred, or both combined, seem to have given wings to me&mdash;no fish
      ever shot through the water, no bird through the air, with the hurried
      feeling of liberty and rapture with which I sweep through, this
      night-wind, and over these wolds. Nay, such is the magic of feeling myself
      once more in the saddle, that I could almost swear I am at this moment
      mounted on my own favourite Rosabelle, who was never matched in Scotland
      for swiftness, for ease of motion, and for sureness of foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the horse which bears so dear a burden could speak,&rdquo; answered the
      deep voice of the melancholy George of Douglas, &ldquo;would she not reply, who
      but Rosabelle ought at such an emergence as this to serve her beloved
      mistress, or who but Douglas ought to hold her bridle-rein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Queen Mary started; she foresaw at once all the evils like to arise to
      herself and him from the deep enthusiastic passion of this youth; but her
      feelings as a woman, grateful at once and compassionate, prevented her
      assuming the dignity of a Queen, and she endeavoured to continue the
      conversation in an indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methought,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I heard that, at the division of my spoils,
      Rosabelle had become the property of Lord Morton's paramour and ladye-love
      Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noble palfrey had indeed been destined to so base a lot,&rdquo; answered
      Douglas; &ldquo;she was kept under four keys, and under the charge of a numerous
      crew of grooms and domestics&mdash;but Queen Mary needed Rosabelle, and
      Rosabelle is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it well, Douglas,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, &ldquo;when such fearful risks of
      various kinds must needs be encountered, that you should augment their
      perils to yourself for a subject of so little moment as a palfrey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call that of little moment,&rdquo; answered Douglas, &ldquo;which has afforded
      you a moment's pleasure?&mdash;Did you not start with joy when I first
      said you were mounted on Rosabelle?&mdash;And to purchase you that
      pleasure, though it were to last no longer than the flash of lightning
      doth, would not Douglas have risked his life a thousand times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, peace, Douglas, peace,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;this is unfitting language;
      and, besides, I would speak,&rdquo; said she, recollecting herself, &ldquo;with the
      Abbot of Saint Mary's&mdash;Nay, Douglas, I will not let you quit my rein
      in displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Displeasure, lady!&rdquo; answered Douglas: &ldquo;alas! sorrow is all that I can
      feel for your well-warranted contempt&mdash;I should be as soon displeased
      with Heaven for refusing the wildest wish which mortal can form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abide by my rein, however,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;there is room for my Lord Abbot
      on the other side; and, besides, I doubt if his assistance would be so
      useful to Rosabelle and me as yours has been, should the road again
      require it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot came up on the other side, and she immediately opened a
      conversation with him on the topic of the state of parties, and the plan
      fittest for her to pursue inconsequence of her deliverance. In this
      conversation Douglas took little share, and never but when directly
      applied to by the Queen, while, as before, his attention seemed entirely
      engrossed by the care of Mary's personal safety. She learned, however, she
      had a new obligation to him, since, by his contrivance, the Abbot, whom he
      had furnished with the family pass-word, was introduced into the castle as
      one of the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before daybreak they ended their hasty and perilous journey before
      the gates of Niddrie, a castle in West Lothian, belonging to Lord Seyton.
      When the Queen was about to alight, Henry Seyton, preventing Douglas,
      received her in his arms, and, kneeling down, prayed her Majesty to enter
      the house of his father, her faithful servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;may repose yourself here in perfect safety&mdash;it
      is already garrisoned with good men for your protection; and I have sent a
      post to my father, whose instant arrival, at the head of five hundred men,
      may be looked for. Do not dismay yourself, therefore, should your sleep be
      broken by the trampling of horse; but only think that here are some scores
      more of the saucy Seytons come to attend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by better friends than the Saucy Seytons, a Scottish Queen cannot be
      guarded,&rdquo; replied Mary. &ldquo;Rosabelle went fleet as the summer breeze, and
      well-nigh as easy; but it is long since I have been a traveller, and I
      feel that repose will be welcome.&mdash;Catherine, <i>ma mignone</i>, you
      must sleep in my apartment to-night, and bid me welcome to your noble
      father's castle.&mdash;Thanks, thanks to all my kind deliverers&mdash;thanks,
      and a good night is all I can now offer; but if I climb once more to the
      upper side of Fortune's wheel, I will not have her bandage. Mary Stewart
      will keep her eyes open, and distinguish her friends.&mdash;Seyton, I need
      scarcely recommend the venerable Abbot, the Douglas, and my page, to your
      honour able care and hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Seyton bowed, and Catherine and Lady Fleming attended the Queen to
      her apartment; where, acknowledging to them that she should have found it
      difficult in that moment to keep her promise of holding her eyes open, she
      resigned herself to repose, and awakened not till the morning was
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's first feeling when she awoke, was the doubt of her freedom; and the
      impulse prompted her to start from bed, and hastily throwing her mantle
      over her shoulders, to look out at the casement of her apartment. Oh,
      sight of joy! instead of the crystal sheet of Lochleven, unaltered save by
      the influence of the wind, a landscape of wood and moorland lay before
      her, and the park around the castle was occupied by the troops of her most
      faithful and most favourite nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, rise, Catherine,&rdquo; cried the enraptured Princess; &ldquo;arise and come
      hither!&mdash;here are swords and spears in true hands, and glittering
      armour on loyal breasts. Here are banners, my girl, floating in the wind,
      as lightly as summer clouds&mdash;Great God! what pleasure to my weary
      eyes to trace their devices&mdash;thine own brave father's&mdash;the
      princely Hamilton's&mdash;the faithful Fleming's&mdash;See&mdash;see&mdash;they
      have caught a glimpse of me, and throng towards the window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung the casement open, and with her bare head, from which the
      tresses flew back loose and dishevelled, her fair arm slenderly veiled by
      her mantle, returned by motion and sign the exulting shouts of the
      warriors, which echoed for many a furlong around. When the first burst of
      ecstatic joy was over, she recollected how lightly she was dressed, and,
      putting her hands to her face, which was covered with blushes at the
      recollection, withdrew abruptly from the window. The cause of her retreat
      was easily conjectured, and increased the general enthusiasm for a
      Princess, who had forgotten her rank in her haste to acknowledge the
      services of her subjects. The unadorned beauties of the lovely woman, too,
      moved the military spectators more than the highest display of her regal
      state might; and what might have seemed too free in her mode of appearing
      before them, was more than atoned for by the enthusiasm of the moment and
      by the delicacy evinced in her hasty retreat. Often as the shouts died
      away, as often were they renewed, till wood and hill rung again; and many
      a deep path was made that morning on the cross of the sword, that the hand
      should not part with the weapon, till Mary Stewart was restored to her
      rights. But what are promises, what the hopes of mortals? In ten days,
      these gallant and devoted votaries were slain, were captives, or had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary flung herself into the nearest seat, and still blushing, yet half
      smiling, exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Ma mignone</i>, what will they think of me?&mdash;to
      show myself to them with my bare feet hastily thrust into the slippers&mdash;only
      this loose mantle about me&mdash;my hair loose on my shoulders&mdash;my
      arms and neck so bare&mdash;Oh, the best they can suppose is, that her
      abode in yonder dungeon has turned their Queen's brain! But my rebel
      subjects saw me exposed when I was in the depth of affliction, why should
      I hold colder ceremony with these faithful and loyal men?&mdash;Call
      Fleming, however&mdash;I trust she has not forgotten the little mail with
      my apparel&mdash;We must be as brave as we can, <i>mignóne</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam, our good Lady Fleming was in no case to remember any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jest, Catherine,&rdquo; said the Queen, somewhat offended; &ldquo;it is not in
      her nature surely, to forget her duty so far as to leave us without a
      change of apparel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roland Graeme, madam, took care of that,&rdquo; answered Catherine; &ldquo;for he
      threw the mail, with your highness's clothes and jewels, into the boat,
      ere he ran back to lock the gate&mdash;I never saw so awkward a page as
      that youth&mdash;the packet well-nigh fell on my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall make thy heart amends, my girl,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, laughing, &ldquo;for
      that and all other offences given. But call Fleming, and let us put
      ourselves into apparel to meet our faithful lords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such had been the preparations, and such was the skill of Lady Fleming,
      that the Queen appeared before her assembled nobles in such attire as
      became, though it could not enhance, her natural dignity. With the most
      winning courtesy, she expressed to each individual her grateful thanks,
      and dignified not only every noble, but many of the lesser barons by her
      particular attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whither now, my lords?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what way do your counsels
      determine for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Draphane Castle,&rdquo; replied Lord Arbroath, &ldquo;if your Majesty is so
      pleased; and thence to Dunbarton, to place your Grace's person in safety,
      after which we long to prove if these traitors will abide us in the
      field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do we journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We propose,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton, &ldquo;if your Grace's fatigue will permit, to
      take horse after the morning's meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pleasure, my Lords, is mine,&rdquo; replied the Queen; &ldquo;we will rule our
      journey by your wisdom now, and hope hereafter to have the advantage of
      governing by it our kingdom.&mdash;You will permit my ladies and me, my
      good lords, to break our fasts along with you&mdash;We must be half
      soldiers ourselves, and set state apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low bowed many a helmeted head at this gracious proffer, when the Queen,
      glancing her eyes through the assembled leaders, missed both Douglas and
      Roland Graeme, and inquired for them in a whisper to Catherine Seyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in yonder oratory, madam, sad enough,&rdquo; replied Catherine; and
      the Queen observed that her favourite's eyes were red with weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must not be,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Keep the company amused&mdash;I will
      seek them, and introduce them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the oratory, where the first she met was George Douglas,
      standing, or rather reclining, in the recess of a window, his back rested
      against the wall, and his arms folded on his breast. At the sight of the
      Queen he started, and his countenance showed, for an instant, an
      expression of intense delight, which was instantly exchanged for his usual
      deep melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Douglas, why does the first deviser and bold
      executor of the happy scheme for our freedom, shun the company of his
      fellow-nobles, and of the Sovereign whom he has obliged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Douglas, &ldquo;those whom you grace with your presence bring
      followers to aid your cause, wealth to support your state,&mdash;can offer
      you halls in which to feast, and impregnable castles for your defence. I
      am a houseless and landless man&mdash;disinherited by my mother, and laid
      under her malediction&mdash;disowned by my name and kindred&mdash;who
      bring nothing to your standard but a single sword, and the poor life of
      its owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to upbraid me, Douglas,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;by showing what
      you have lost for my sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, madam!&rdquo; interrupted the young man, eagerly; &ldquo;were it to do
      again, and had I ten times as much rank and wealth, and twenty times as
      many friends to lose, my losses would be overpaid by the first step you
      made, as a free princess, upon the soil of your native kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then ails you, that you will not rejoice with those who rejoice
      upon the same joyful occasion?&rdquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the youth,&rdquo; though exheridated and disowned, I am yet a
      Douglas: with most of yonder nobles my family have been in feud for ages&mdash;a
      cold reception amongst them, were an insult, and a kind one yet more
      humiliating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Douglas,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;shake off this unmanly gloom!&mdash;I
      can make thee match for the best of them in title and fortune, and,
      believe me, I will.&mdash;Go then amongst them, I command you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That word,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;is enough&mdash;I go. This only let me say,
      that not for wealth or title would I have done that which I have done&mdash;Mary
      Stewart will not, and the Queen cannot, reward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he left the oratory, mingled with the nobles, and placed
      himself at the bottom of the table. The Queen looked after him, and put
      her kerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Our Lady pity me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for no sooner are my prison cares
      ended, than those which beset me as a woman and a Queen again thicken
      around me.&mdash;Happy Elizabeth! to whom political interest is every
      thing, and whose heart never betrays thy head.&mdash;And now must I seek
      this other boy, if I would prevent daggers-drawing betwixt him and the
      young Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roland Graeme was in the same oratory, but at such a distance from
      Douglas, that he could not overhear what passed betwixt the Queen and him.
      He also was moody and thoughtful, but cleared his brow at the Queen's
      question, &ldquo;How now, Roland? you are negligent in your attendance this
      morning. Are you so much overcome with your night's ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, gracious madam,&rdquo; answered Graeme; &ldquo;but I am told the page of
      Lochleven is not the page of Niddrie Castle; and so Master Henry Seyton
      hath in a manner been pleased to supersede my attendance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Heaven forgive me,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;how soon these cock-chickens
      begin to spar!&mdash;with children and boys, at least, I may be a queen.&mdash;I
      will have you friends.&mdash;Some one send me Henry Seyton hither.&rdquo; As she
      spoke the last words aloud, the youth whom she had named entered the
      apartment. &ldquo;Come hither,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Henry Seyton&mdash;I will have you
      give your hand to this youth, who so well aided in the plan of my escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, madam,&rdquo; answered Seyton, &ldquo;so that the youth will grant me, as
      a boon, that he touch not the hand of another Seyton whom he knows of. My
      hand has passed current for hers with him before now&mdash;and to win my
      friendship, he must give up thoughts of my sister's love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Seyton,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;does it become you to add any condition
      to my command?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;I am the servant of your Grace's throne, son to the
      most loyal man in Scotland. Our goods, our castles, our blood, are yours:
      Our honour is in our own keeping. I could say more, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, speak on, rude boy,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;what avails it that I am
      released from Lochleven, if I am thus enthralled under the yoke of my
      pretended deliverers, and prevented from doing justice to one who has
      deserved as well of me as yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not in this distemperature for me, sovereign Lady,&rdquo; said Roland; &ldquo;this
      young gentleman, being the faithful servant of your Grace, and the brother
      of Catherine Seyton, bears that about him which will charm down my passion
      at the hottest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn thee once more,&rdquo; said Henry Seyton, haughtily, &ldquo;that you make no
      speech which may infer that the daughter of Lord Seyton can be aught to
      thee beyond what she is to every churl's blood in Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was again about to interfere, for Roland's complexion rose, and
      it became somewhat questionable how long his love for Catherine would
      suppress the natural fire of his temper. But the interposition of another
      person, hitherto unseen, prevented Mary's interference, There was in the
      oratory a separate shrine, enclosed with a high screen of pierced oak,
      within which was placed an image of Saint Bennet, of peculiar sanctity.
      From this recess, in which she had been probably engaged in her devotions,
      issued suddenly Magdalen Graeme, and addressed Henry Seyton, in reply to
      his last offensive expressions,&mdash;&ldquo;And of what clay, then, are they
      moulded these Seytons, that the blood of the Graemes may not aspire to
      mingle with theirs? Know, proud boy, that when I call this youth my
      daughter's child, I affirm his descent from Malise Earl of Strathern,
      called Malise with the Bright Brand; and I trow the blood of your house
      springs from no higher source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good mother,&rdquo; said Seyton, &ldquo;methinks your sanctity should make you
      superior to these worldly vanities; and indeed it seems to have rendered
      you somewhat oblivious touching them, since, to be of gentle descent, the
      father's name and lineage must be as well qualified as the mother's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I say he comes of the blood of Avenel by the father's side,&rdquo;
       replied Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;name I not blood as richly coloured as thine
      own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Avenel?&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;is my page descended of Avenel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, gracious Princess, and the last male heir of that ancient house&mdash;Julian
      Avenel was his father, who fell in battle against the Southron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard the tale of sorrow,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;it was thy daughter,
      then, who followed that unfortunate baron to the field, and died on his
      body? Alas! how many ways does woman's affection find to work out her own
      misery! The tale has oft been told and sung in hall and bower&mdash;And
      thou, Roland, art that child of misfortune, who was left among the dead
      and dying? Henry Seyton, he is thine equal in blood and birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely so,&rdquo; said Henry Seyton, &ldquo;even were he legitimate; but if the
      tale be told and sung aright, Julian Avenel was a false knight, and his
      leman a frail and credulous maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by Heaven, thou liest!&rdquo; said Roland Graeme, and laid his hand on his
      sword. The entrance of Lord Seyton, however, prevented violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, my lord,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;and separate these wild and untamed
      spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Henry,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;are my castle, and the Queen's presence, no
      checks on thine insolence and impetuosity?&mdash;And with whom art thou
      brawling?&mdash;unless my eyes spell that token false, it is with the very
      youth who aided me so gallantly in the skirmish with the Leslies&mdash;Let
      me look, fair youth, at the medal which thou wearest in thy cap. By Saint
      Bennet, it is the same!&mdash;Henry, I command thee to forbear him, as
      thou lovest my blessing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you honour my command,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;good service hath he done
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; replied young Seyton, &ldquo;as when he carried the billet enclosed
      in the sword-sheath to Lochleven&mdash;marry, the good youth knew no more
      than a pack-horse what he was carrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I who dedicated him to this great work,&rdquo; said Magdalen Graeme&mdash;&ldquo;I,
      by whose advice and agency this just heir hath been unloosed from her
      thraldom&mdash;I, who spared not the last remaining hope of a falling
      house in this great action&mdash;I, at least, knew and counselled; and
      what merit may be mine, let the reward, most gracious Queen, descend upon
      this youth. My ministry here is ended; you are free&mdash;a sovereign
      Princess, at the head of a gallant army, surrounded by valiant barons&mdash;My
      service could avail you no farther, but might well prejudice you; your
      fortune now rests upon men's hearts and men's swords. May they prove as
      trusty as the faith of women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave us, mother,&rdquo; said the Queen&mdash;&ldquo;you whose practices
      in our favour were so powerful, who dared so many dangers, and wore so
      many disguises, to blind our enemies and to confirm our friends&mdash;you
      will not leave us in the dawn of our reviving fortunes, ere we have time
      to know and to thank you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot know her,&rdquo; answered Magdalen Graeme, &ldquo;who knows not herself&mdash;there
      are times, when, in this woman's frame of mine, there is the strength of
      him of Gath&mdash;in this overtoiled brain, the wisdom of the most sage
      counsellor&mdash;and again the mist is on me, and my strength is weakness,
      my wisdom folly. I have spoken before princes and cardinals&mdash;ay,
      noble Princess, even before the princes of thine own house of Lorraine;
      and I know not whence the words of persuasion came which flowed from my
      lips, and were drunk in by their ears.&mdash;And now, even when I most
      need words of persuasion, there is something which chokes my voice, and
      robs me of utterance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there be aught in my power to do thee pleasure,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;the
      barely naming it shall avail as well as all thine eloquence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sovereign Lady,&rdquo; replied the enthusiast, &ldquo;it shames me that at this high
      moment something of human frailty should cling to one, whose vows the
      saints have heard, whose labours in the rightful cause Heaven has
      prospered. But it will be thus while the living spirit is shrined in the
      clay of mortality&mdash;I will yield to the folly,&rdquo; she said, weeping as
      she spoke, &ldquo;and it shall be the last.&rdquo; Then seizing Roland's hand, she led
      him to the Queen's feet, kneeling herself upon one knee, and causing him
      to kneel on both. &ldquo;Mighty Princess,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;look on this flower&mdash;it
      was found by a kindly stranger on a bloody field of battle, and long it
      was ere my anxious eyes saw, and my arms pressed, all that was left of my
      only daughter. For your sake, and for that of the holy faith we both
      profess, I could leave this plant, while it was yet tender, to the nurture
      of strangers&mdash;ay, of enemies, by whom, perchance, his blood would
      have been poured forth as wine, had the heretic Glendinning known that he
      had in his house the heir of Julian Avenel. Since then I have seen him
      only in a few hours of doubt and dread, and now I part with the child of
      my love&mdash;for ever&mdash;for ever!&mdash;Oh, for every weary step I
      have made in your rightful cause, in this and in foreign lands, give
      protection to the child whom I must no more call mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, mother,&rdquo; said the Queen, deeply affected, &ldquo;that, for your
      sake and his own, his happiness and fortunes shall be our charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, daughter of princes,&rdquo; said Magdalen, and pressed her lips,
      first to the Queen's hand, then to the brow of her grandson. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
       she said, drying her tears, and rising with dignity, &ldquo;Earth has had its
      own, and Heaven claims the rest.&mdash;Lioness of Scotland, go forth and
      conquer! and if the prayers of a devoted votaress can avail thee, they
      will rise in many a land, and from many a distant shrine. I will glide
      like a ghost from land to land, from temple to temple; and where the very
      name of my country is unknown, the priests shall ask who is the Queen of
      that distant northern land, for whom the aged pilgrim was so fervent in
      prayer. Farewell! Honour be thine, and earthly prosperity, if it be the
      will of God&mdash;if not, may the penance thou shalt do here ensure thee
      happiness hereafter!&mdash;Let no one speak or follow me&mdash;my
      resolution is taken&mdash;my vow cannot be cancelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glided from their presence as she spoke, and her last look was upon
      her beloved grandchild. He would have risen and followed, but the Queen
      and Lord Seyton interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Press not on her now,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton, &ldquo;if you would not lose her for
      ever. Many a time have we seen the sainted mother, and often at the most
      needful moment; but to press on her privacy, or to thwart her purpose, is
      a crime which she cannot pardon. I trust we shall yet see her at her need&mdash;a
      holy woman she is for certain, and dedicated wholly to prayer and penance;
      and hence the heretics hold her as one distracted, while true Catholics
      deem her a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me then hope,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;that you, my lord, will aid me in the
      execution of her last request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in the protection of my young second?&mdash;cheerfully&mdash;that
      is, in all that your majesty can think it fitting to ask of me.&mdash;Henry,
      give thy hand upon the instant to Roland Avenel, for so I presume he must
      now be called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall be Lord of the Barony,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;if God prosper our
      rightful arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can only be to restore it to my kind protectress, who now holds it,&rdquo;
       said young Avenel. &ldquo;I would rather be landless, all my life, than she lost
      a rood of ground by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Queen, looking to Lord Seyton, &ldquo;his mind matches his birth&mdash;Henry,
      thou hast not yet given thy hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his,&rdquo; said Henry, giving it with some appearance of courtesy, but
      whispering Roland at the same time,&mdash;&ldquo;For all this, thou hast not my
      sister's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please your Grace,&rdquo; said Lord Seyton, &ldquo;now that these passages are
      over, to honour our poor meal. Time it were that our banners were
      reflected in the Clyde. We must to horse with as little delay as may be.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ay, sir&mdash;our ancient crown, in these wild times,
  Oft stood upon a cast&mdash;the gamester's ducat,
  So often staked, and lost, and then regain'd,
  Scarce knew so many hazards.
                          THE SPANISH FATHER.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is not our object to enter into the historical part of the reign of the
      ill-fated Mary, or to recount how, during the week which succeeded her
      flight from Lochleven, her partisans mustered around her with their
      followers, forming a gallant army, amounting to six thousand men. So much
      light has been lately thrown on the most minute details of the period, by
      Mr. Chalmers, in his valuable history of Queen Mary, that the reader may
      be safely referred to it for the fullest information which ancient records
      afford concerning that interesting time. It is sufficient for our purpose
      to say, that while Mary's head-quarters were at Hamilton, the Regent and
      his adherents had, in the King's name, assembled a host at Glasgow,
      inferior indeed to that of the Queen in numbers, but formidable from the
      military talents of Murray, Morton, the Laird of Grange, and others, who
      had been trained from their youth in foreign and domestic wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these circumstances, it was the obvious policy of Queen Mary to avoid a
      conflict, secure that were her person once in safety, the number of her
      adherents must daily increase; whereas, the forces of those opposed to her
      must, as had frequently happened in the previous history of her reign,
      have diminished, and their spirits become broken. And so evident was this
      to her counsellors, that they resolved their first step should be to place
      the Queen in the strong castle of Dunbarton, there to await the course of
      events, the arrival of succours from France, and the levies which were
      made by her adherents in every province of Scotland. Accordingly, orders
      were given, that all men should be on horseback or on foot, apparelled in
      their armour, and ready to follow the Queen's standard in array of battle,
      the avowed determination being to escort her to the Castle of Dunbarton in
      defiance of her enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muster was made upon Hamilton-Moor, and the march commenced in all the
      pomp of feudal times. Military music sounded, banners and pennons waved,
      armour glittered far and wide, and spears glanced and twinkled like stars
      in a frosty sky. The gallant spectacle of warlike parade was on this
      occasion dignified by the presence of the Queen herself, who, with a fair
      retinue of ladies and household attendants, and a special guard of
      gentlemen, amongst whom young Seyton and Roland were distinguished, gave
      grace at once and confidence to the army, which spread its ample files
      before, around, and behind her. Many churchmen also joined the cavalcade,
      most of whom did not scruple to assume arms, and declare their intention
      of wielding them in defence of Mary and the Catholic faith. Not so the
      Abbot of Saint Mary's. Roland had not seen this prelate since the night of
      their escape from Lochleven, and he now beheld him, robed in the dress of
      his order, assume his station near the Queen's person. Roland hastened to
      pull off his basnet, and beseech the Abbot's blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast it, my son!&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;I see thee now under thy true
      name, and in thy rightful garb. The helmet with the holly branch befits
      your brows well&mdash;I have long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew of my descent, my good father?&rdquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so, but it was under seal of confession from thy grandmother; nor
      was I at liberty to tell the secret, till she herself should make it
      known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her reason for such secrecy, my father?&rdquo; said Roland Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear, perchance of my brother&mdash;a mistaken fear, for Halbert would
      not, to ensure himself a kingdom, have offered wrong to an orphan; besides
      that, your title, in quiet times, even had your father done your mother
      that justice which I well hope he did, could not have competed with that
      of my brother's wife, the child of Julian's elder brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They need fear no competition from me,&rdquo; said Avenel. &ldquo;Scotland is wide
      enough, and there are many manors to win, without plundering my
      benefactor. But prove to me, my reverend father, that my father was just
      to my mother&mdash;show me that I may call myself a legitimate Avenel, and
      make me your bounden slave for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Abbot, &ldquo;I hear the Seytons hold thee cheap for that
      stain on thy shield. Something, however, I have learnt from the late Abbot
      Boniface, which, if it prove sooth, may redeem that reproach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me that blessed news,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;and the future service of my
      life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rash boy!&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;I should but madden thine impatient temper,
      by exciting hopes that may never be fulfilled&mdash;and is this a time for
      them? Think on what perilous march we are bound, and if thou hast a sin
      unconfessed, neglect not the only leisure which Heaven may perchance
      afford thee for confession and absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be time enough for both, I trust, when we reach Dunbarton,&rdquo;
       answered the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;thou crowest as loudly as the rest&mdash;but we are
      not yet at Dunbarton, and there is a lion in the path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean you Murray, Morton, and the other rebels at Glasgow, my reverend
      father? Tush! they dare not look on the royal banner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; replied the Abbot, &ldquo;speak many of those who are older, and
      should be wiser, than thou.&mdash;I have returned from the southern
      shires, where I left many a chief of name arming in the Queen's interest&mdash;I
      left the lords here wise and considerate men&mdash;I find them madmen on
      my return&mdash;they are willing, for mere pride and vain-glory, to brave
      the enemy, and to carry the Queen, as it were in triumph, past the walls
      of Glasgow, and under the beards of the adverse army.&mdash;Seldom does
      Heaven smile on such mistimed confidence. We shall be encountered, and
      that to the purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so much the better,&rdquo; replied Roland; &ldquo;the field of battle was my
      cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware it be not thy dying bed,&rdquo; said the Abbot. &ldquo;But what avails it
      whispering to young wolves the dangers of the chase? You will know,
      perchance, ere this day is out, what yonder men are, whom you hold in rash
      contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what are they?&rdquo; said Henry Seyton, who now joined them: &ldquo;have they
      sinews of wire, and flesh of iron?&mdash;Will lead pierce and steel cut
      them?&mdash;If so, reverend father, we have little to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are evil men,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;but the trade of war demands no
      saints.&mdash;Murray and Morton are known to be the best generals in
      Scotland. No one ever saw Lindesay's or Ruthven's back&mdash;Kirkaldy of
      Grange was named by the Constable Montmorency the first soldier in Europe&mdash;My
      brother, too good a name for such a cause, has been far and wide known for
      a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better, the better!&rdquo; said Seyton, triumphantly; &ldquo;we shall have all
      these traitors of rank and name in a fair field before us. Our cause is
      the best, our numbers are the strongest, our hearts and limbs match theirs&mdash;Saint
      Bennet, and set on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot made no reply, but seemed lost in reflection; and his anxiety in
      some measure communicated itself to Roland Avenel, who ever, as their line
      of march led over a ridge or an eminence, cast an anxious look towards the
      towers of Glasgow, as if he expected to see symptoms of the enemy issuing
      forth. It was not that he feared the fight, but the issue was of such deep
      import to his country, and to himself, that the natural fire of his spirit
      burned with a less lively, though with a more intense glow. Love, honour,
      fame, fortune, all seemed to depend on the issue of one field, rashly
      hazarded perhaps, but now likely to become unavoidable and decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at length, their march came to be nearly parallel with the city of
      Glasgow, Roland became sensible that the high grounds before them were
      already in part occupied by a force, showing, like their own, the royal
      banner of Scotland, and on the point of being supported by columns of
      infantry and squadrons of horse, which the city gates had poured forth,
      and which hastily advanced to sustain those troops who already possessed
      the ground in front of the Queen's forces. Horseman after horseman
      galloped in from the advanced guard, with tidings that Murray had taken
      the field with his whole army; that his object was to intercept the
      Queen's march, and his purpose unquestionable to hazard a battle. It was
      now that the tempers of men were subjected to a sudden and a severe trial;
      and that those who had too presumptuously concluded that they would pass
      without combat, were something disconcerted, when, at once, and with
      little time to deliberate, they found themselves placed in front of a
      resolute enemy.&mdash;Their chiefs immediately assembled around the Queen,
      and held a hasty council of war. Mary's quivering lip confessed the fear
      which she endeavoured to conceal under a bold and dignified demeanour. But
      her efforts were overcome by painful recollections of the disastrous issue
      of her last appearance in arms at Carberry-hill; and when she meant to
      have asked them their advice for ordering the battle, she involuntarily
      inquired whether there were no means of escaping without an engagement?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaping?&rdquo; answered the Lord Seyton; &ldquo;when I stand as one to ten of your
      Highness's enemies, I may think of escape&mdash;but never while I stand
      with three to two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Battle! battle!&rdquo; exclaimed the assembled lords; &ldquo;we will drive the rebels
      from their vantage ground, as the hound turns the hare on the hill side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, my noble lords,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;it were as well to prevent
      his gaining that advantage.&mdash;Our road lies through yonder hamlet on
      the brow, and whichever party hath the luck to possess it, with its little
      gardens and enclosures, will attain a post of great defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reverend father is right,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Oh, haste thee, Seyton,
      haste, and get thither before them&mdash;they are marching like the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seyton bowed low, and turned his horse's head.&mdash;&ldquo;Your Highness
      honours me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will instantly press forward, and seize the
      pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before me, my lord, whose charge is the command of the vanguard,&rdquo;
       said the Lord of Arbroath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you, or any Hamilton in Scotland,&rdquo; said the Seyton, &ldquo;having the
      Queen's command&mdash;Follow me, gentlemen, my vassals and kinsmen&mdash;Saint
      Bennet, and set on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And follow me,&rdquo; said Arbroath, &ldquo;my noble kinsmen, and brave men-tenants,
      we will see which will first reach the post of danger. For God and Queen
      Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill-omened haste, and most unhappy strife,&rdquo; said the Abbot, who saw them
      and their followers rush hastily and emulously to ascend the height
      without waiting till their men were placed in order.&mdash;&ldquo;And you,
      gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Roland and Seyton, who were each
      about to follow those who hastened thus disorderly to the conflict, &ldquo;will
      you leave the Queen's person unguarded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave me not, gentlemen!&rdquo; said the Queen&mdash;&ldquo;Roland and Seyton, do
      not leave me&mdash;there are enough of arms to strike in this fell combat&mdash;withdraw
      not those to whom I trust for my safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may not leave her Grace,&rdquo; said Roland, looking at Seyton, and turning
      his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ever looked when thou wouldst find out that,&rdquo; rejoined the fiery youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland made no answer, but bit his lip till the blood came, and spurring
      his horse up to the side of Catherine Seyton's palfrey, he whispered in a
      low voice, &ldquo;I never thought to have done aught to deserve you; but this
      day I have heard myself upbraided with cowardice, and my sword remained
      still sheathed, and all for the love of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is madness among us all,&rdquo; said the damsel; &ldquo;my father, my brother,
      and you, are all alike bereft of reason. Ye should think only of this poor
      Queen, and you are all inspired by your own absurd jealousies&mdash;The
      monk is the only soldier and man of sense amongst you all.&mdash;My lord
      Abbot,&rdquo; she cried aloud, &ldquo;were it not better we should draw to the
      westward, and wait the event that God shall send us, instead of remaining
      here in the highway, endangering the Queen's person, and cumbering the
      troops in their advance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say well, my daughter,&rdquo; replied the Abbot; &ldquo;had we but one to guide
      us where the Queen's person may be in safety&mdash;Our nobles hurry to the
      conflict, without casting a thought on the very cause of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said a knight, or man-at-arms, well mounted, and attired
      completely in black armour, but having the visor of his helmet closed, and
      bearing no crest on his helmet, or device upon his shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will follow no stranger,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;without some warrant of his
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a stranger and in your hands,&rdquo; said the horseman; &ldquo;if you wish to
      know more of me, the Queen herself will be your warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen had remained fixed to the spot, as if disabled by fear, yet
      mechanically smiling, bowing, and waving her hand, as banners were lowered
      and spears depressed before her, while, emulating the strife betwixt
      Seyton and Arbroath, band on band pressed forward their march towards the
      enemy. Scarce, however, had the black rider whispered something in her
      ear, than she assented to what he said; and when he spoke aloud, and with
      an air of command, &ldquo;Gentlemen, it is the Queen's pleasure that you should
      follow me,&rdquo; Mary uttered, with something like eagerness, the word &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were in motion in an instant; for the black horseman, throwing off a
      sort of apathy of manner, which his first appearance indicated, spurred
      his horse to and fro, making him take such active bounds and short turns,
      as showed the rider master of the animal; and getting the Queen's little
      retinue in some order for marching, he led them to the left, directing his
      course towards a castle, which, crowning a gentle yet commanding eminence,
      presented an extensive view over the country beneath, and in particular,
      commanded a view of those heights which both armies hastened to occupy,
      and which it was now apparent must almost instantly be the scene of
      struggle and dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder towers,&rdquo; said the Abbot, questioning the sable horseman, &ldquo;to whom
      do they belong?&mdash;and are they in the hands of friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are untenanted,&rdquo; replied the stranger, &ldquo;or, at least, they have no
      hostile inmates.&mdash;But urge these youths. Sir Abbot, to make more
      haste&mdash;this is but an evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity, by
      peering out upon the battle in which they are to take no share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worse luck mine,&rdquo; said Henry Seyton, who overheard him&mdash;&ldquo;I would
      rather be under my father's banner at this moment than be made Chamberlain
      of Holyrood, for this my present duty of peaceful ward well and patiently
      discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your place under your father's banner will shortly be right dangerous,&rdquo;
       said Roland Avenel, who, pressing his horse towards the westward, had
      still his look reverted to the armies; &ldquo;for I see yonder body of cavalry,
      which presses from the eastward, will reach the village ere Lord Seyton
      can gain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are but cavalry,&rdquo; said Seyton, looking attentively; &ldquo;they cannot
      hold the village without shot of harquebuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look more closely,&rdquo; said Roland; &ldquo;you will see that each of these
      horseman who advance so rapidly from Glasgow, carries a footman behind
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by Heaven, he speaks well!&rdquo; said the black cavalier; &ldquo;one of you two
      must go carry the news to Lord Seyton and Lord Arbroath, that they hasten
      not their horsemen on before the foot, but advance more regularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that my errand,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;for I first marked the stratagem of the
      enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by your leave,&rdquo; said Seyton, &ldquo;yonder is my father's banner engaged,
      and it best becomes me to go to the rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stand by the Queen's decision,&rdquo; said Roland Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What new appeal?&mdash;what new quarrel?&rdquo; said Queen Mary&mdash;&ldquo;Are
      there not in yonder dark host enemies enough to Mary Stewart, but must her
      very friends turn enemies to each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;the young master of Seyton and I did but
      dispute who should leave your person to do a most needful message to the
      host. He thought his rank entitled him, and I deemed that the person of
      least consequence, being myself, were better perilled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;if one must leave me, be it Seyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Seyton bowed till the white plumes on his helmet mixed with the
      flowing mane of his gallant war-horse, then placed himself firm in the
      saddle, shook his lance aloft with an air of triumph and determination,
      and striking his horse with the spurs, made towards his father's banner,
      which was still advancing up the hill, and dashed his steed over every
      obstacle that occurred in his headlong path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother! my father!&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, with an expression of
      agonized apprehension&mdash;&ldquo;they are in the midst of peril, and I in
      safety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;that I were with them, and could ransom
      every drop of their blood by two of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know thou dost wish it?&rdquo; said Catherine&mdash;&ldquo;Can a woman say
      to a man what I have well-nigh said to thee, and yet think that he could
      harbour fear or faintness of heart?&mdash;There is that in yon distant
      sound of approaching battle that pleases me even while it affrights me. I
      would I were a man, that I might feel that stern delight, without the
      mixture of terror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride up, ride up, Lady Catherine Seyton,&rdquo; cried the Abbot, as they still
      swept on at a rapid pace, and were now close beneath the walls of the
      castle&mdash;&ldquo;ride up, and aid Lady Fleming to support the Queen&mdash;she
      gives way more and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They halted and lifted Mary from the saddle, and were about to support her
      towards the castle, when she said faintly, &ldquo;Not there&mdash;not there&mdash;these
      walls will I never enter more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a Queen, madam,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;and forget that you are a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must forget much, much more,&rdquo; answered the unfortunate Mary, in an
      under tone, &ldquo;ere I can look with steady eyes on these well-known scenes!&mdash;I
      must forget the days which I spent here as the bride of the lost&mdash;the
      murdered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the Castle of Crookstone,&rdquo; said the Lady Fleming, &ldquo;in which the
      Queen held her first court after she was married to Darnley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;thy hand is upon us!&mdash;Bear yet up, madam&mdash;your
      foes are the foes of Holy Church, and God will this day decide whether
      Scotland shall be Catholic or heretic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy and continued fire of cannon and musketry, bore a tremendous
      burden to his words, and seemed far more than they to recall the spirits
      of the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To yonder tree,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a yew-tree which grew on a small
      mount close to the castle; &ldquo;I know it well&mdash;from thence you may see a
      prospect wide as from the peaks of Schehallion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And freeing herself from her assistants, she walked with a determined, yet
      somewhat wild step, up to the stem of the noble yew. The Abbot, Catherine,
      and Roland Avenel followed her, while Lady Fleming kept back the inferior
      persons of her train. The black horseman also followed the Queen, waiting
      on her as closely as the shadow upon the light, but ever remaining at the
      distance of two or three yards&mdash;-he folded his arms on his bosom,
      turned his back to the battle, and seemed solely occupied by gazing on
      Mary, through the bars of his closed visor. The Queen regarded him not,
      but fixed her eyes upon the spreading yew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, fair and stately tree,&rdquo; she said, as if at the sight of it she had
      been rapt away from the present scene, and had overcome the horror which
      had oppressed her at the first approach to Crookstone, &ldquo;there thou
      standest, gay and goodly as ever, though thou hearest the sounds of war,
      instead of the vows of love. All is gone since I last greeted thee&mdash;love
      and lover&mdash;vows and vower&mdash;king and kingdom.&mdash;How goes the
      field, my Lord Abbot?&mdash;with us, I trust&mdash;yet what but evil can
      Mary's eyes witness from this spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her attendants eagerly bent their eyes on the field of battle, but could
      discover nothing more than that it was obstinately contested. The small
      enclosures and cottage gardens in the village, of which they had a full
      and commanding view, and which shortly before lay, with their lines of
      sycamore and ash-trees, so still and quiet in the mild light of a May sun,
      were now each converted into a line of fire, canopied by smoke; and the
      sustained and constant report of the musketry and cannon, mingled with the
      shouts of meeting combatants, showed that as yet neither party had given
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many a soul finds its final departure to heaven or hell, in these awful
      thunders,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;let those that believe in the Holy Church,
      join me in orisons for victory in this dreadful combat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here&mdash;not here,&rdquo; said the unfortunate Queen; &ldquo;pray not here,
      father, or pray in silence&mdash;my mind is too much torn between the past
      and the present, to dare to approach the heavenly throne&mdash;Or, if we
      will pray, be it for one whose fondest affections have been her greatest
      crimes, and who has ceased to be a queen, only because she was a deceived
      and a tender-hearted woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it not well,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;that I rode somewhat nearer the hosts,
      and saw the fate of the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, in the name of God,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;for if our friends are
      scattered, our flight must be hasty&mdash;but beware thou approach not too
      nigh the conflict; there is more than thine own life depends on thy safe
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go not too nigh,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;but fail not to see how the
      Seytons fight, and how they bear themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, I will be on my guard,&rdquo; said Roland Avenel; and without
      waiting farther answer, rode towards the scene of conflict, keeping, as he
      rode, the higher and unenclosed ground, and ever looking cautiously around
      him, for fear of involving himself in some hostile party. As he
      approached, the shots rung sharp and more sharply on his ear, the shouts
      came wilder and wilder, and he felt that thick beating of the heart, that
      mixture of natural apprehension, intense curiosity, and anxiety for the
      dubious event, which even the bravest experience when they approach alone
      to a scene of interest and of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he drew so close, that from a bank, screened by bushes and
      underwood, he could distinctly see where the struggle was most keenly
      maintained. This was in a hollow way, leading to the village, up which the
      Queen's vanguard had marched, with more hasty courage than well-advised
      conduct, for the purpose of possessing themselves of that post of
      advantage. They found their scheme anticipated, and the hedges and
      enclosures already occupied by the enemy, led by the celebrated Kirkaldy
      of Grange and the Earl of Morton; and not small was the loss which they
      sustained while struggling forward to come to close with the men-at-arms
      on the other side. But, as the Queen's followers were chiefly noblemen and
      barons, with their kinsmen and followers, they had pressed onward,
      contemning obstacles and danger, and had, when Roland arrived on the
      ground, met hand to hand at the gorge of the pass with the Regent's
      vanguard, and endeavoured to bear them out of the village at the
      spear-point; while their foes, equally determined to keep the advantage
      which they had attained, struggled with the like obstinacy to drive back
      the assailants. Both parties were on foot, and armed in proof; so that,
      when the long lances of the front ranks were fixed in each other's
      shields, corslets, and breastplates, the struggle resembled that of two
      bulls, who fixing their frontlets hard against each other, remain in that
      posture for hours, until the superior strength or obstinacy of the one
      compels the other to take to flight, or bears him down to the earth. Thus
      locked together in the deadly struggle, which swayed slowly to and fro, as
      one or other party gained the advantage, those who fell were trampled on
      alike by friends and foes; those whose weapons were broken, retired from
      the front rank, and had their place supplied by others; while the rearward
      ranks, unable otherwise to share in the combat, fired their pistols, and
      hurled their daggers, and the points and truncheons of the broken weapons,
      like javelins against the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God and the Queen!&rdquo; resounded from the one party; &ldquo;God and the King!&rdquo;
       thundered from the other; while, in the name of their sovereign,
      fellow-subjects on both sides shed each other's blood, and, in the name of
      their Creator, defaced his image. Amid the tumult was often heard the
      voices of the captains, shouting their commands; of leaders and chiefs,
      crying their gathering words; of groans and shrieks from the falling and
      the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strife had lasted nearly an hour. The strength of both parties seemed
      exhausted; but their rage was unabated, and their obstinacy unsubdued,
      when Roland, who turned eye and ear to all around him, saw a column of
      infantry, headed by a few horsemen, wheel round the base of the bank where
      he had stationed himself, and, levelling their long lances, attack the
      Queen's vanguard, closely engaged as they were in conflict on their front.
      The very first glance showed him that the leader who directed this
      movement was the Knight of Avenel, his ancient master; and the next
      convinced him, that its effects would be decisive. The result of the
      attack of fresh and unbroken forces upon the flank of those already
      wearied with a long and obstinate struggle, was, indeed, instantaneous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The column of the assailants, which had hitherto shown one dark, dense,
      and united line of helmets, surmounted with plumage, was at once broken
      and hurled in confusion down the hill, which they had so long endeavoured
      to gain. In vain were the leaders heard calling upon their followers to
      stand to the combat, and seen personally resisting when all resistance was
      evidently vain. They were slain, or felled to the earth, or hurried
      backwards by the mingled tide of flight and pursuit. What were Roland's
      feelings on beholding the rout, and feeling that all that remained for him
      was to turn bridle, and endeavour to ensure the safety of the Queen's
      person! Yet, keen as his grief and shame might be, they were both
      forgotten, when, almost close beneath the bank which he occupied, he saw
      Henry Seyton forced away from his own party in the tumult, covered with
      dust and blood, and defending himself desperately against several of the
      enemy who had gathered around him, attracted by his gay armour. Roland
      paused not a moment, but pushing his steed down the bank, leaped him
      amongst the hostile party, dealt three or four blows amongst them, which
      struck down two, and made the rest stand aloof; then reaching Seyton his
      hand, he exhorted him to seize fast on his horse's mane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live or die together this day,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;keep but fast hold till we
      are out of the press, and then my horse is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seyton heard and exerted his remaining strength, and, by their joint
      efforts, Roland brought him out of danger, and behind the spot from whence
      he had witnessed the disastrous conclusion of the fight. But no sooner
      were they under shelter of the trees, than Seyton let go his hold, and, in
      spite of Roland's efforts to support him, fell at length on the turf.
      &ldquo;Trouble yourself no more with me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is my first and my last
      battle&mdash;and I have already seen too much to wish to see the close.
      Hasten to save the Queen&mdash;and commend me to Catherine&mdash;she will
      never more be mistaken for me nor I for her&mdash;the last sword-stroke
      has made an eternal distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me aid you to mount my horse,&rdquo; said Roland, eagerly, &ldquo;and you may yet
      be saved&mdash;I can find my own way on foot&mdash;turn but my horse's
      head westward, and he will carry you fleet and easy as the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never mount steed more,&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;farewell&mdash;I love
      thee better dying, than ever I thought to have done while in life&mdash;I
      would that old man's blood were not on my hand!&mdash;<i>Sancte Benedicte,
      ora pro me</i>&mdash;Stand not to look on a dying man, but haste to save
      the Queen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were spoken with the last effort of his voice, and scarce were
      they uttered ere the speaker was no more. They recalled Roland to a sense
      of the duty which he had well-nigh forgotten, but they did not reach his
      ears only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen&mdash;where is the Queen?&rdquo; said Halbert Glendinning, who,
      followed by two or three horsemen, appeared at this instant. Roland made
      no answer, but, turning his horse, and confiding in his speed, gave him at
      once rein and spur, and rode over height and hollow towards the Castle of
      Crookstone. More heavily armed, and mounted upon a horse of less speed,
      Sir Halbert Glendinning followed with couched lance, calling out as he
      rode, &ldquo;Sir, with the holly-branch, halt, and show your right to bear that
      badge&mdash;fly not thus cowardly, nor dishonour the cognizance thou
      deservest not to wear!&mdash;Halt, sir coward, or by Heaven, I will strike
      thee with my lance on the back, and slay thee like a dastard&mdash;I am
      the Knight of Avenel&mdash;I am Halbert Glendinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Roland, who had no purpose of encountering his old master, and who,
      besides, knew the Queen's safety depended on his making the best speed he
      could, answered not a word to the defiances and reproaches which Sir
      Halbert continued to throw out against him; but making the best use of his
      spurs, rode yet harder than before, and had gained about a hundred yards
      upon his pursuer, when, coming near to the yew-tree where he had left the
      Queen, he saw them already getting to horse, and cried out as loud as he
      could, &ldquo;Foes! foes!&mdash;Ride for it, fair ladies&mdash;Brave gentlemen,
      do your devoir to protect them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he wheeled his horse, and avoiding the shock of Sir Halbert
      Glendinning, charged one of that Knight's followers, who was nearly on a
      line with him, so rudely with his lance, that he overthrew horse and man.
      He then drew his sword and attacked the second, while the black
      man-at-arms, throwing himself in the way of Glendinning, they rushed on
      each other so fiercely, that both horses were overthrown, and the riders
      lay rolling on the plain. Neither was able to arise, for the black
      horseman was pierced through with Glendinning's lance, and the Knight of
      Avenel, oppressed with the weight of his own horse and sorely bruised
      besides, seemed in little better plight than he whom he had mortally
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yield thee, Sir Knight of Avenel, rescue or no rescue,&rdquo; said Roland, who
      had put a second antagonist out of condition to combat, and hastened to
      prevent Glendinning from renewing the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not choose but yield,&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, &ldquo;since I can no longer
      fight; but it shames me to speak such a word to a coward like thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me not coward,&rdquo; said Roland, lifting his visor, and helping his
      prisoner to rise, &ldquo;since but for old kindness at thy hands, and yet more
      at thy lady's, I had met thee as a brave man should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The favourite page of my wife!&rdquo; said Sir Halbert, astonished; &ldquo;Ah!
      wretched boy, I have heard of thy treason at Lochleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reproach him not, my brother,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;he was but an agent in
      the hands of Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To horse, to horse!&rdquo; said Catherine Seyton; &ldquo;mount and begone, or we are
      all lost. I see our gallant army flying for many a league&mdash;To horse,
      my Lord Abbot&mdash;To horse, Roland&mdash;my gracious Liege, to horse!
      Ere this, we should have ridden many a mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look on these features,&rdquo; said Mary, pointing to the dying knight, who had
      been unhelmed by some compassionate hand; &ldquo;look there, and tell me if she
      who ruins all who love her, ought to fly a foot farther to save her
      wretched life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader must have long anticipated the discovery which the Queen's
      feelings had made before her eyes confirmed it. It was the features of the
      unhappy George Douglas, on which death was stamping his mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look&mdash;look at him well,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;thus has it been with all
      who loved Mary Stewart!&mdash;The royalty of Francis, the wit of
      Chastelar, the power and gallantry of the gay Gordon, the melody of
      Rizzio, the portly form and youthful grace of Darnley, the bold address
      and courtly manners of Bothwell&mdash;and now the deep-devoted passion of
      the noble Douglas&mdash;nought could save them!&mdash;they looked on the
      wretched Mary, and to have loved her was crime enough to deserve early
      death! No sooner had the victim formed a kind thought of me, than the
      poisoned cup, the axe and block, the dagger, the mine, were ready to
      punish them for casting away affection on such a wretch as I am!&mdash;Importune
      me not&mdash;I will fly no farther&mdash;I can die but once, and I will
      die here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke, her tears fell fast on the face of the dying man, who
      continued to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness of passion, which death
      itself could hardly subdue.&mdash;&ldquo;Mourn not for me,&rdquo; he said faintly,
      &ldquo;but care for your own safety&mdash;I die in mine armour as a Douglas
      should, and I die pitied by Mary Stewart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He expired with these words, and without withdrawing his eyes from her
      face; and the Queen, whose heart was of that soft and gentle mould, which
      in domestic life, and with a more suitable partner than Darnley, might
      have made her happy, remained weeping by the dead man, until recalled to
      herself by the Abbot, who found it necessary to use a style of unusual
      remonstrance. &ldquo;We also, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we, your Grace's devoted
      followers, have friends and relatives to weep for. I leave a brother in
      imminent jeopardy&mdash;the husband of the Lady Fleming&mdash;the father
      and brothers of the Lady Catherine, are all in yonder bloody field, slain,
      it is to be feared, or prisoners. We forget the fate of our nearest and
      dearest, to wait on our Queen, and she is too much occupied with her own
      sorrows to give one thought to ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve not your reproach, father,&rdquo; said the Queen, checking her tears;
      &ldquo;but I am docile to it&mdash;where must we go&mdash;what must we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must fly, and that instantly,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;whither is not so
      easily answered, but we may dispute it upon the road&mdash;Lift her to her
      saddle, and set forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: I am informed in the most polite manner, by D. MacVean, Esq. of
      Glasgow, that I have been incorrect in my locality, in giving an account
      of the battle of Langside. Crookstone Castle, he observes, lies four miles
      west from the field of battle, and rather in the rear of Murray's army.
      The real place from which Mary saw the rout of her last army, was Cathcart
      Castle, which, being a mile and a half east from Langside, was, situated
      in the rear of the Queen's own army. I was led astray in the present case,
      by the authority of my deceased friend, James Grahame the excellent and
      amiable author of the Sabbath, in his drama on the subject of Queen Mary;
      and by a traditionary report of Mary having seen the battle from the
      Castle of Crookstone, which seemed so much to increase the interest of the
      scene, that I have been unwilling to make, in this particular instance,
      the fiction give way to the fact, which last is undoubtedly in favour of
      Mr. MacVean's system.
    </p>

      It is singular how tradition, which is sometimes a sure guide to truth,
      is, in other cases, prone to mislead us. In the celebrated field of battle
      at Killiecrankie, the traveller is struck with one of those rugged pillars
      of rough stone, which indicate the scenes of ancient conflict. A friend of
      the author, well acquainted with the circumstances of the battle, was
      standing near this large stone, and looking on the scene around, when a
      highland shepherd hurried down from the hill to offer his services as
      cicerone, and proceeded to inform him, that Dundee was slain at that
      stone, which was raised to his memory. &ldquo;Fie, Donald.&rdquo; answered my friend,
      &ldquo;how can you tell such a story to a stranger? I am sure you know well
      enough that Dundee was killed at a considerable distance from this place,
      near the house of Fascally, and that this stone was here long before the
      battle, in 1688.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oich! oich!&rdquo; said Donald, no way abashed, &ldquo;and
      your honour's in the right, and I see you ken a' about it. And he wasna
      killed on the spot neither, but lived till the next morning; but a' the
      Saxon gentlemen like best to hear he was killed at the great stane.&rdquo; It is
      on the same principle of pleasing my readers, that I retain Crookstone
      Castle instead of Cathcart.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, the author has taken a liberty in removing the actual field
      of battle somewhat to the eastward, he has been tolerably strict in
      adhering to the incidents of the engagement, as will appear from it
      comparison of events in the novel, with the following account from an old
      writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Regent was out on foot and all his company, except the Laird of
      Grange, Alexander Hume of Manderston, and some borderers to the number of
      two hundred. The Laird of Grange had already viewed the ground, and with
      all imaginable diligence caused every horseman to take behind him a
      footman of the Regent's, to guard behind them, and rode with speed to the
      head of Langside-hill, and set down the footmen with their culverings at
      the head of a straight lane, where there were some cottage houses and
      yards of great advantage. Which soldiers with their continual shot killed
      divers of the vaunt guard, led by the Hamiltons, who, courageously and
      fiercely ascending up the hill, were already out of breath, when the
      Regent's vaunt guard joined with them. Where the worthy Lord Hume fought
      on foot with his pike in his hand very manfully, assisted by the Laird of
      Cessford, his brother-in-law, who helped him up again when he was strucken
      to the ground by many strokes upon his face, through the throwing pistols
      at him after they had been discharged. He was also wounded with staves,
      and had many strokes of spears through his legs; for he and Grange, at the
      joining, cried to let their adversaries first lay down their spears, to
      bear up theirs; which spears were so thick fixed in the others' jacks,
      that some of the pistols and great staves that were thrown by them which
      were behind, might be seen lying upon the spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the Queen's side the Earl of Argyle commanded the battle, and the
      Lord of Arbroth the vaunt guard. But the Regent committed to the Laird of
      Grange the special care, as being an experimented captain, to oversee
      every danger, and to ride to every wing, to encourage and make help where
      greatest need was. He perceived, at the first joining, the right wing of
      the Regent's vaunt guard put back and like to fly, whereof the greatest
      part were commons of the barony of Renfrew; whereupon he rode to them, and
      told them that their enemy was already turning their backs, requesting
      them to stay and debate till he should bring them fresh men forth of the
      battle. Whither at full speed he did ride alone, and told the Regent that
      the enemy were shaken and flying away behind the little village, and
      desired a few number of fresh men to go with him. Where he found enough
      willing, as the Lord Lindesay, the Laird of Lochleven, Sir James Balfour,
      and all the Regent's servants, who followed him with diligence, and
      reinforced that wing which was beginning to fly; which fresh men with
      their loose weapons struck the enemies in their flank and faces, which
      forced them incontinent to give place and turn back after long fighting
      and pushing others to and fro with their spears. There were not many
      horsemen to pursue after them, and the Regent cried to save and not to
      kill, and Grange was never cruel, so that there were few slain and taken.
      And the only slaughter was at the first rencounter by the shot of the
      soldiers, which Grange had planted at the lane head behind some dikes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that, while passing through the small town of Renfrew,
      some partisans, adherents of the House of Lennox, attempting to arrest
      Queen Mary and her attendants, were obliged to make way for her not
      without slaughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off accordingly&mdash;Roland lingered a moment to command the
      attendants of the Knight of Avenel to convey their master to the Castle of
      Crookstone, and to say that he demanded from him no other condition of
      liberty, than his word, that he and his followers would keep secret the
      direction in which the Queen fled. As he turned his rein to depart, the
      honest countenance of Adam Woodcock stared upon him with an expression of
      surprise, which, at another time, would have excited his hearty mirth. He
      had been one of the followers who had experienced the weight of Roland's
      arm, and they now knew each other, Roland having put up his visor, and the
      good yeoman having thrown away his barret-cap, with the iron bars in
      front, that he might the more readily assist his master. Into this
      barret-cap, as it lay on the ground, Roland forgot not to drop a few gold
      pieces, (fruits of the Queen's liberality,) and with a signal of kind
      recollection and enduring friendship, he departed at full gallop to
      overtake the Queen, the dust raised by her train being already far down
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not fairy-money,&rdquo; said honest Adam, weighing and handling the gold&mdash;&ldquo;And
      it was Master Roland himself, that is a certain thing&mdash;the same open
      hand, and, by our Lady!&rdquo; (shrugging his shoulders)&mdash;&ldquo;the same ready
      fist!&mdash;My Lady will hear of this gladly, for she mourns for him as if
      he were her son. And to see how gay he is! But these light lads are as
      sure to be uppermost as the froth to be on the top of the quart-pot&mdash;Your
      man of solid parts remains ever a falconer.&rdquo; So saying, he went to aid his
      comrades, who had now come up in greater numbers, to carry his master into
      the Castle of Crookstone.

      Chapter the Thirty-Eighth.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My native land, good night!
                            BYRON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Many a bitter tear was shed, during the hasty flight of Queen Mary, over
      fallen hopes, future prospects, and slaughtered friends. The deaths of the
      brave Douglas, and of the fiery but gallant young Seyton, seemed to affect
      the Queen as much as the fall from the throne, on which she had so nearly
      been again seated. Catherine Seyton devoured in secret her own grief,
      anxious to support the broken spirits of her mistress; and the Abbot,
      bending his troubled thoughts upon futurity, endeavoured in vain to form
      some plan which had a shadow of hope. The spirit of young Roland&mdash;for
      he also mingled in the hasty debates held by the companions of the Queen's
      flight&mdash;continued unchecked and unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has lost a battle&mdash;Your ancestor, Bruce,
      lost seven successively, ere he sat triumphant on the Scottish throne, and
      proclaimed with the voice of a victor, in the field of Bannockburn, the
      independence of his country. Are not these heaths, which we may traverse
      at will, better than the locked, guarded, and lake-moated Castle of
      Lochleven?&mdash;We are free&mdash;in that one word there is comfort for
      all our losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck a bold note, but the heart of Mary made no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I had still been in Lochleven, than seen the
      slaughter made by rebels among the subjects who offered themselves to
      death for my sake. Speak not to me of farther efforts&mdash;they would
      only cost the lives of you, the friends who recommend them! I would not
      again undergo what I felt, when I saw from yonder mount the swords of the
      fell horsemen of Morton raging among the faithful Seytons and Hamiltons,
      for their loyalty to their Queen&mdash;I would not again feel what I felt
      when Douglas's life-blood stained my mantle for his love to Mary Stewart&mdash;not
      to be empress of all that Britain's seas enclose. Find for me some place
      where I can hide my unhappy head, which brings destruction on all who love
      it&mdash;it is the last favour that Mary asks of her faithful followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this dejected mood, but still pursuing her flight with unabated
      rapidity, the unfortunate Mary, after having been joined by Lord Herries
      and a few followers, at length halted, for the first time, at the Abbey of
      Dundrennan, nearly sixty miles distant from the field of battle. In this
      remote quarter of Galloway, the Reformation not having yet been strictly
      enforced against the monks, a few still lingered in their cells
      unmolested; and the Prior, with tears and reverence, received the fugitive
      Queen at the gate of his convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring you ruin, my good father,&rdquo; said the Queen, as she was lifted from
      her palfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is welcome,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;if it comes in the train of duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Placed on the ground, and supported by her ladies, the Queen looked for an
      instant at her palfrey, which, jaded and drooping its head, seemed as if
      it mourned the distresses of its mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Roland,&rdquo; said the Queen, whispering, &ldquo;let Rosabelle be cared for&mdash;ask
      thy heart, and it will tell thee why I make this trifling request even in
      this awful hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was conducted to her apartment, and in the hurried consultation of her
      attendants, the fatal resolution of the retreat to England was finally
      adopted. In the morning it received her approbation, and a messenger was
      despatched to the English warden, to pray him for safe-conduct and
      hospitality, on the part of the Queen of Scotland. On the next day the
      Abbot Ambrose walked in the garden of the Abbey with Roland, to whom he
      expressed his disapprobation of the course pursued. &ldquo;It is madness and
      ruin,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;better commit herself to the savage Highlanders or wild
      Bordermen, than to the faith of Elizabeth. A woman to a rival woman&mdash;a
      presumptive successor to the keeping of a jealous and childless Queen!&mdash;Roland,
      Herries is true and loyal, but his counsel has ruined his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ruin follows us every where,&rdquo; said an old man, with a spade in his
      hand, and dressed like a lay-brother, of whose presence, in the vehemence
      of his exclamation, the Abbot had not been aware&mdash;&ldquo;Gaze not on me
      with such wonder!&mdash;I am he who was the Abbot Boniface at Kennaquhair,
      who was the gardener Blinkhoolie at Lochleven, hunted round to the place
      in which I served my noviciate, and now ye are come to rouse me up again!&mdash;A
      weary life I have had for one to whom peace was ever the dearest
      blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will soon rid you of our company, good father,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;and
      the Queen will, I fear, trouble your retreat no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you said as much before,&rdquo; said the querulous old man, &ldquo;and yet I was
      put forth from Kinross, and pillaged by troopers on the road.&mdash;They
      took from me the certificate that you wot of&mdash;that of the Baron&mdash;ay,
      he was a moss-trooper like themselves&mdash;You asked me of it, and I
      could never find it, but they found it&mdash;it showed the marriage of&mdash;of&mdash;my
      memory fails me&mdash;Now see how men differ! Father Nicholas would have
      told you an hundred tales of the Abbot Ingelram, on whose soul God have
      mercy!&mdash;He was, I warrant you, fourscore and six, and I am not more
      than&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not Avenel the name you seek, my good father?&rdquo; said Roland,
      impatiently, yet moderating his tone for fear of alarming or offending the
      infirm old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, right&mdash;Avenel, Julian Avenel&mdash;You are perfect in the name&mdash;I
      kept all the special confessions, judging it held with my vow to do so&mdash;I
      could not find it when my successor, Ambrosius, spoke on't&mdash;but the
      troopers found it, and the Knight who commanded the party struck his
      breast, till the target clattered like an empty watering-can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Mary!&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;in whom could such a paper excite such
      interest! What was the appearance of the knight, his arms, his colours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye distract me with your questions&mdash;I dared hardly look at him&mdash;they
      charged me with bearing letters for the Queen, and searched my mail&mdash;This
      was all along of your doings at Lochleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust in God,&rdquo; said the Abbot to Roland, who stood beside him,
      shivering and trembling &ldquo;with impatience,&rdquo; the paper has fallen into the
      hands of my brother&mdash;I heard he had been with his followers on the
      scout betwixt Stirling and Glasgow.&mdash;Bore not the Knight a
      holly-bough on his helmet?&mdash;Canst thou not remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, remember&mdash;remember,&rdquo; said the old man pettishly; &ldquo;count as many
      years as I do, if your plots will let you, and see what, and how much, you
      remember.&mdash;Why, I scarce remember the pear-mains which I graffed here
      with my own hands some fifty years since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a bugle sounded loudly from the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the death-blast to Queen Mary's royalty,&rdquo; said Ambrosius; &ldquo;the
      English warden's answer has been received, favourable doubtless, for when
      was the door of the trap closed against the prey which it was set for?&mdash;Droop
      not, Roland&mdash;this matter shall be sifted to the bottom&mdash;but we
      must not now leave the Queen&mdash;follow me&mdash;let us do our duty, and
      trust the issue with God&mdash;Farewell, good Father&mdash;I will visit
      thee again soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to leave the garden, followed by Roland, with half-reluctant
      steps. The Ex-Abbot resumed his spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could be sorry for these men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ay, and for that poor Queen,
      but what avail earthly sorrows to a man of fourscore?&mdash;and it is a
      rare dropping morning for the early colewort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is stricken with age,&rdquo; said Ambrosius, as he dragged Roland down to
      the sea-beach; &ldquo;we must let him take his time to collect himself&mdash;nothing
      now can be thought on but the fate of the Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They soon arrived where she stood, surrounded by her little train, and by
      her side the sheriff of Cumberland, a gentleman of the house of Lowther,
      richly dressed and accompanied by soldiers. The aspect of the Queen
      exhibited a singular mixture of alacrity and reluctance to depart. Her
      language and gestures spoke hope and consolation to her attendants, and
      she seemed desirous to persuade even herself that the step she adopted was
      secure, and that the assurance she had received of kind reception was
      altogether satisfactory; but her quivering lip, and unsettled eye,
      betrayed at once her anguish at departing from Scotland, and her fears of
      confiding herself to the doubtful faith of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, my Lord Abbot,&rdquo; she said, speaking to Ambrosius, &ldquo;and you,
      Roland Avenel, we have joyful news for you&mdash;our loving sister's
      officer proffers us, in her name, a safe asylum from the rebels who have
      driven us from our home&mdash;only it grieves me we must here part from
      you for a short space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part from us, madam!&rdquo; said the Abbot. &ldquo;Is your welcome in England, then,
      to commence with the abridgment of your train, and dismissal of your
      counsellors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it not thus, good Father,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;the Warden and the Sheriff,
      faithful servants of our Royal Sister, deem it necessary to obey her
      instructions in the present case, even to the letter, and can only take
      upon them to admit me with my female attendants. An express will instantly
      be despatched from London, assigning me a place of residence; and I will
      speedily send to all of you whenever my Court shall be formed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Court formed in England! and while Elizabeth lives and reigns?&rdquo; said
      the Abbot&mdash;&ldquo;that will be when we shall see two suns in one heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think so,&rdquo; replied the Queen; &ldquo;we are well assured of our sister's
      good faith. Elizabeth loves fame&mdash;and not all that she has won by her
      power and her wisdom will equal that which she will acquire by extending
      her hospitality to a distressed sister!&mdash;not all that she may
      hereafter do of good, wise, and great, would blot out the reproach of
      abusing our confidence.&mdash;Farewell, my page&mdash;now my knight&mdash;farewell
      for a brief season. I will dry the tears of Catherine, or I will weep with
      her till neither of us can weep longer.&rdquo;&mdash;She held out her hand to
      Roland, who flinging himself on his knees, kissed it with much emotion. He
      was about to render the same homage to Catherine, when the Queen, assuming
      an air of sprightliness, said, &ldquo;Her lips, thou foolish boy! and,
      Catherine, coy it not&mdash;these English gentlemen should see, that, even
      in our cold clime, Beauty knows how to reward Bravery and Fidelity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not now to learn the force of Scottish beauty, or the mettle of
      Scottish valour,&rdquo; said the Sheriff of Cumberland, courteously&mdash;&ldquo;I
      would it were in my power to bid these attendants upon her who is herself
      the mistress of Scottish beauty, as welcome to England as my poor cares
      would make them. But our Queen's orders are positive in case of such an
      emergence, and they must not be disputed by her subject.&mdash;May I
      remind your Majesty that the tide ebbs fast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff took the Queen's hand, and she had already placed her foot on
      the gangway, by which she was to enter the skiff, when the Abbot, starting
      from a trance of grief and astonishment at the words of the Sheriff,
      rushed into the water, and seized upon her mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She foresaw it!&mdash;She foresaw it!&rdquo;&mdash;he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;she
      foresaw your flight into her realm; and, foreseeing it, gave orders you
      should be thus received. Blinded, deceived, doomed&mdash;Princess! your
      fate is sealed when you quit this strand.&mdash;Queen of Scotland, thou
      shalt not leave thine heritage!&rdquo; he continued, holding a still firmer
      grasp upon her mantle; &ldquo;true men shall turn rebels to thy will, that they
      may save thee from captivity or death. Fear not the bills and bows whom
      that gay man has at his beck&mdash;we will withstand him by force. Oh, for
      the arm of my warlike brother!&mdash;Roland Avenel, draw thy sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen stood irresolute and frightened; one foot upon the plank, the
      other on the sand of her native shore, which she was quitting for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What needs this violence, Sir Priest?&rdquo; said the Sheriff of Cumberland; &ldquo;I
      came hither at your Queen's command, to do her service; and I will depart
      at her least order, if she rejects such aid as I can offer. No marvel is
      it if our Queen's wisdom foresaw that such chance as this might happen
      amidst the turmoils of your unsettled State; and, while willing to afford
      fair hospitality to her Royal Sister, deemed it wise to prohibit the
      entrance of a broken army of her followers into the English frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; said Queen Mary, gently unloosing her robe from the Abbot's
      grasp, &ldquo;that we exercise full liberty of choice in leaving this shore;
      and, questionless, the choice will remain free to us in going to France,
      or returning to our own dominions, as we shall determine&mdash;Besides, it
      is too late&mdash;Your blessing, Father, and God speed thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May He have mercy on thee, Princess, and speed thee also!&rdquo; said the
      Abbot, retreating. &ldquo;But my soul tells me I look on thee for the last
      time!&rdquo; The sails were hoisted, the oars were plied, the vessel went
      freshly on her way through the firth, which divides the shores of
      Cumberland from those of Galloway; but not till the vessel diminished to
      the size of a child's frigate, did the doubtful, and dejected, and
      dismissed followers of the Queen cease to linger on the sands; and long,
      long could they discern the kerchief of Mary, as she waved the
      oft-repeated signal of adieu to her faithful adherents, and to the shores
      of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      If good tidings of a private nature could have consoled Roland for parting
      with his mistress, and for the distresses of his sovereign, he received
      such comfort some days subsequent to the Queen's leaving Dundrennan. A
      breathless post&mdash;no other than Adam Woodcock&mdash;brought despatches
      from Sir Halbert Glendinning to the Abbot, whom he found with Roland,
      still residing at Dundrennan, and in vain torturing Boniface with fresh
      interrogations. The packet bore an earnest invitation to his brother to
      make Avenel Castle for a time his residence. &ldquo;The clemency of the Regent,&rdquo;
       said the writer, &ldquo;has extended pardon both to Roland and to you, upon
      condition of your remaining a time under my wardship. And I have that to
      communicate respecting the parentage of Roland, which not only you will
      willingly listen to, but which will be also found to afford me, as the
      husband of his nearest relative, some interest in the future course of his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot read this letter, and paused, as if considering what were best
      for him to do. Meanwhile, Woodcock took Roland side, and addressed him as
      follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Now, look, Mr. Roland, that you do not let any papestrie
      nonsense lure either the priest or you from the right quarry. See you, you
      ever bore yourself as a bit of a gentleman. Read that, and thank God that
      threw old Abbot Boniface in our way, as two of the Seyton's men were
      conveying him towards Dundrennan here.&mdash;We searched him for
      intelligence concerning that fair exploit of yours at Lochleven, that has
      cost many a man his life, and me a set of sore bones&mdash;and we found
      what is better for your purpose than ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper which he gave, was, indeed, an attestation by Father Philip,
      subscribing himself unworthy Sacristan, and brother of the House of Saint
      Mary's, stating, &ldquo;that under a vow of secrecy he had united, in the holy
      sacrament of marriage, Julian Avenel and Catherine Graeme; but that Julian
      having repented of his union, he, Father Philip, had been sinfully
      prevailed on by him to conceal and disguise the same, according to a
      complot devised betwixt him and the said Julian Avenel, whereby the poor
      damsel was induced to believe that the ceremony had been performed by one
      not in holy orders, and having no authority to that effect. Which sinful
      concealment the undersigned conceived to be the cause why he was abandoned
      to the misguiding of a water-fiend, whereby he had been under a spell,
      which obliged him to answer every question, even touching the most solemn
      matters, with idle snatches of old songs, besides being sorely afflicted
      with rheumatic pains ever after. Wherefore he had deposited this
      testificate and confession with the day and date of the said marriage,
      with his lawful superior Boniface, Abbot of Saint Mary's, <i>sub sigillo
      confessionis</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared by a letter from Julian, folded carefully up with the
      certificate, that the Abbot Boniface had, in effect, bestirred himself in
      the affair, and obtained from the Baron a promise to avow his marriage;
      but the death of both Julian and his injured bride, together with the
      Abbot's resignation, his ignorance of the fate of their unhappy offspring,
      and above all, the good father's listless and inactive disposition, had
      suffered the matter to become totally forgotten, until it was recalled by
      some accidental conversation with the Abbot Ambrosius concerning the
      fortunes of the Avenel family. At the request of his successor, the
      quondam Abbot made search for it; but as he would receive no assistance in
      looking among the few records of spiritual experiences and important
      confessions, which he had conscientiously treasured, it might have
      remained for ever hidden amongst them, but for the more active researches
      of Sir Halbert Glendinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you are like to be heir of Avenel at last, Master Roland, after
      my lord and lady have gone to their place,&rdquo; said Adam; &ldquo;and as I have but
      one boon to ask, I trust you will not nick me with nay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it be in my power to say yes, my trusty friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, I must needs, if I live to see that day, keep on feeding the
      eyases with unwashed flesh,&rdquo; said Woodcock sturdily, as if doubting the
      reception that his request might meet with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt feed them with what you list for me,&rdquo; said Roland, laughing;
      &ldquo;I am not many months older than when I left the Castle, but I trust I
      have gathered wit enough to cross no man of skill in his own vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would not change places with the King's falconer,&rdquo; said Adam
      Woodcock, &ldquo;nor with the Queen's neither&mdash;but they say she will be
      mewed up and never need one.&mdash;I see it grieves you to think of it,
      and I could grieve for company; but what help for it?&mdash;Fortune will
      fly her own flight, let a man hollo himself hoarse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbot and Roland journeyed to Avenel, where the former was tenderly
      received by his brother, while the lady wept for joy to find that in her
      favourite orphan she had protected the sole surviving branch of her own
      family. Sir Halbert Glendinning and his household were not a little
      surprised at the change which a brief acquaintance with the world had
      produced in their former inmate, and rejoiced to find, in the pettish,
      spoiled, and presuming page, a modest and unassuming young man, too much
      acquainted with his own expectations and character, to be hot or petulant
      in demanding the consideration which was readily and voluntarily yielded
      to him. The old Major Domo Wingate was the first to sing his praises, to
      which Mistress Lilias bore a loud echo, always hoping that God would teach
      him the true gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the true gospel the heart of Roland had secretly long inclined, and the
      departure of the good Abbot for France, with the purpose of entering into
      some house of his order in that kingdom, removed his chief objection to
      renouncing the Catholic faith. Another might have existed in the duty
      which he owed to Magdalen Graeme, both by birth and from gratitude. But he
      learned, ere he had been long a resident in Avenel, that his grandmother
      had died at Cologne, in the performance of a penance too severe for her
      age, which she had taken upon herself in behalf of the Queen and Church of
      Scotland, as soon as she heard of the defeat at Langside. The zeal of the
      Abbot Ambrosius was more regulated; but he retired into the Scottish
      convent of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and so lived there, that the fraternity
      were inclined to claim for him the honours of canonization. But he guessed
      their purpose, and prayed them, on his death-bed, to do no honours to the
      body of one as sinful as themselves; but to send his body and his heart to
      be buried in Avenel burial-aisle, in the monastery of Saint Mary's, that
      the last Abbot of that celebrated house of devotion might sleep among its
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: This was not the explanation of the incident of searching for
      the heart, mentioned in the introduction to the tale, which the author
      originally intended. It was designed to refer to the heart of Robert
      Bruce. It is generally known that that great monarch, being on his
      death-bed, bequeathed to the good Lord James of Douglas, the task of
      carrying his heart to the Holy Land, to fulfil in a certain degree his own
      desire to perform a crusade. Upon Douglas's death, fighting against the
      Moors in Spain, a sort of military hors d'oeuvre to which he could have
      pleaded no regular call of duty, his followers brought back the Bruce's
      heart, and deposited it in the Abbey church of Melrose, the Kennaquhair of
      the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Abbey has been always particularly favoured by the Bruce. We have
      already seen his extreme anxiety that each of the reverend brethren should
      be daily supplied with a service of boiled almonds, rice and milk, pease,
      or the like, to be called the King's mess, and that without the ordinary
      service of their table being either disturbed in quantity or quality. But
      this was not the only mark of the benignity of good King Robert towards
      the monks of Melrose, since, by a charter of the dale 29th May, 1326, he
      conferred on the Abbot of Melrose the sum of two thousand pounds sterling,
      for rebuilding: the church of St. Mary's, ruined by the English; and there
      is little or no doubt that the principal part of the remains which now
      display such exquisite specimens of Gothic architecture, at its very
      purest period, had their origin in this munificent donation. The money was
      to be paid out of crown lands, estates forfeited to the King, and other
      property or demesnes of the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very curious letter written to his son about three weeks before his
      death, has been pointed out to me by my friend Mr. Thomas Thomson,
      Deputy-Register for Scotland. It enlarges so much on the love of the royal
      writer to the community of Melrose, that it is well worthy of being
      inserted in a work connected in some degree with Scottish History.

      &ldquo;Robertius dei gratia Rex Scottorum, David precordialissimo filio suo, ac
      ceteris successoribus suis; Salutem, et sic ejus precepta tenere, ut cum
      sua benedictione possint regnare. Fili carissime, digne censeri videtur
      filius, qui, paternos in bonis mores imitans, piam ejus nititur exequi
      voluntatem; nec proprie sibi sumit nomen heredis, qui salubribus
      predecessoris affectibus non adherit: Cupientes igitur, ut piam
      affectionem et scinceram delectionem, quam erga monasterium de Melros, ubi
      cor nostrum ex speciali devotione disposuimus tumularidum, et erga
      Religiosos ibidem Deo servientes, ipsorum vita sanctissima nos ad hoc
      excitante, concepimus; Tu ceterique successores mei pia scinceritate
      prosequarimi, ut, ex vestre dilectionis affectu dictis Religiosis nostri
      causa post mortem nostrum ostenso, ipsi pro nobis ad orandum ferveucius et
      forcius animentur: Vobis precipimus quantum possumus, instanter
      supplicamus, et ex toto corde injungimus, Quatinus assignacionibus quas
      eisdem yiris Religiosis et fabrica Ecclesie sue de novo fecimus ac eciam
      omnibus aliis donacionibus nostris, ipsos libere gaudere permittatis,
      Easdem potius si necesse fuerit augmentantes quam diminuentes, ipsorum
      peticiones auribus benevolis admittentes, ac ipsos contra suos invasores
      et emuios pia defensione protegentes. Hanc autem exhortacionem

      voluntatem faceret sed paternam. In testimonium autem nostre devotionis
      ergra locum predictum sic a nobis dilectum et electum concepte, presentem
      literam Religiosis predictis dimittimus, nostris successoribus in posterum
      ostendendam. Data apud Cardros, undecimo die Maij, Anno Regni nostri
      vicesimo quarto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this charter be altogether genuine, and there is no appearance of
      forgery, it gives rise to a curious doubt in Scottish History. The letter
      announces that the King had already destined his heart to be deposited at
      Melrose. The resolution to send it to Palestine, under the charge of
      Douglas, must have been adopted betwixt 11th May 1329, the date of the
      letter, and 7th June of the same year, when the Bruce died; or else we
      must suppose that the commission of Douglas extended not only to taking
      the Bruce's heart to Palestine, but to bring it safe back to its final
      place of deposit in the Abbey of Melrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be worth inquiring: by what caprice the author was induced to
      throw the incident of the Bruce's heart entirely out of the story, save
      merely to say, that he found himself unable to fill up the canvass he had
      sketched, and indisposed to prosecute the management of the supernatural
      machinery with which his plan, when it was first rough-hewn, was connected
      and combined.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before that period arrived, Roland Avenel was wedded to Catherine
      Seyton, who, after two years' residence with her unhappy mistress, was
      dismissed upon her being subjected to closer restraint than had been at
      first exercised. She returned to her father's house, and as Roland was
      acknowledged for the successor and lawful heir of the ancient house of
      Avenel, greatly increased as the estate was by the providence of Sir
      Halbert Gleninning, there occurred no objections to the match on the part
      of her family. Her mother was recently dead when she first entered the
      convent; and her father, in the unsettled times which followed Queen
      Mary's flight to England, was not averse to an alliance with a youth, who,
      himself loyal to Queen Mary, still held some influence, through means of
      Sir Halbert Glendinning, with the party in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland and Catherine, therefore, were united, spite of their differing
      faiths; and the White Lady, whose apparition had been infrequent when the
      house of Avenel seemed verging to extinction, was seen to sport by her
      haunted well, with a zone of gold around her bosom as broad as the
      baldrick of an Earl.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
